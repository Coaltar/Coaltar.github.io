## Heisenberg Spin Chains
Undergraduate physics research!
I'm actually having a lot of fun with this project, but it's pretty simple overall.
Just some basic matrix construction and diagonalization using numpy, pandas, scipy etc....
The physic's behind it is pretty interesting though.
I have links to the background research in the [project repo](https://github.com/Coaltar/HeisenbergSpinChains)!


## GodotJam 54
Recently participated in GodotJam 54. It was a lot of fun, but it's always humbling to realize just how much goes into game development, and how much can be reasonably accomplished within a deadline.
Ended up reducing the scope of this game a lot, but I accidentally produced a pretty neat visual effect with the maze.

## Personal Website
I've just finished the first draft of my website! You're reading it!

Essentially it's a fork of [gregdan3's static website generator](https://github.com/gregdan3/gregdan3.github.io ), with some small changes.
It works well, but I really wish I had more time to make it my own.
Will probably do plenty of re-factors in the future to suit my own tastes.

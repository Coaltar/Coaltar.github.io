- I'm learning Astro and Svelte, because obviously I need to rewrite my site(s) again
- I'm learning how to edit videos in fancier ways while I work on my [Toki Pona YouTuber career](https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d), of course

## Finished

- I'm cleaning up my two sites, this one and [my Toki Pona site](https://mun.la) too. No link rot, I've tested every single old link and they all redirect properly!

# Exercise
I have a larger blogpost about how I started exercising
[here](/blog/exercise.html). As of Nov 2021, I started exercising even more.

## Current dailies
- Walk or run ~1mi
- 3 sets of 10 pushups mixed with 3 sets of 10 Fire Hydrants per leg

## Stuff I like
### Needs Equipment
- Pullups
- Chinups
- Running (good shoes. seriously.)

### No Equipment
- Pushups
- Fire Hydrants
- Walking (especially uphill)

## Personal Records
- First sub 10 minute mile: Nov 2021
- Current mile PR: 7:40

## TODO
- Find a strength exercise I like
- Get more used to long runs at a more moderate pace

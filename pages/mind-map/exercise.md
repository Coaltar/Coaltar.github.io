# Exercise

I have a larger blogpost about how I started exercising
[here](/blog/exercise.html). As of Nov 2021, I started exercising even more.

## Current dailies

- Walk or run ~2mi
- 3 sets of 10 pushups mixed with 3 sets of 10 Fire Hydrants per leg

## Stuff I like

### Needs Equipment

- Pullups
- Chinups
- Running (decent shoes and socks. that's it.)

### No Equipment

- Pushups
- Fire Hydrants
- Walking (especially uphill)

## Personal Records

- First sub 10 minute mile: Nov 2021
- Current mile PR: 7:30

## TODO

- Find a strength exercise I like
- Get more used to long runs at a more moderate pace

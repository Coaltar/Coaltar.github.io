# Unity (Udon)

# Notes

> cannot sync non-primitives

> some vars are defined in the game world, and appear null to scripts until interacted

> u# <1.0 cannot use Dictionaries and many other types

> you can fake dictionaries with objects? eeeeeeee

> Public vars of gameObjects become assignable in the editor, AAAAAAAAAAAAAA

> you can't just assign the lineRender's startColor and endColor

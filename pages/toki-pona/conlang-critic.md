TO BE EDITED INTO A GUIDED MICRO-LESSON; I am preserving this here

So, here's a breakdown I'd suggest:

Conlang Critic could be just a proper noun, or you could translate it. In either case, it's entertainment, which is musi. If you use a proper noun your job is done here: "musi Conlang Critic", but you can do a little better when you zoom in on "Conlang Critic"!

A conlang is a kind of toki, rather than a kind of pali, although that isn't entirely wrong either and we will reuse pali. toki do relate to jan, but here we're focusing on the constructed property, being the most important one in this context, to communicate and translate. So, conlangs are toki pali here.

As for critic, we don't need to translate it as a single phrase; critics do one thing: talk about a subject. Let's make that a separate sentence! (note that you can always get more specific, but we want to keep this short and punchy since it's an intro)
Here's the result:
```
o kama pona tawa musi mi! mi toki lon toki pali.
Welcome to my entertainment! I talk about created languages.
```
Breaking an idea into multiple sentences is the common way to express something that is normally said in fewer words (in its source language).

Then, since this is a musi, the rest follows from there:
```
toki sina nanpa wan la musi ni li toki pi lon ala!
In the context of your favorite language, this entertainment tells lies!
```
Except there's a problem: that's not quite the original meaning! "toki pi lon ala" definitely captures the idea of *lying*, but the statement actually says they're getting facts *wrong* about your favorite conlang. This is a mistake, not a lie. Let's try again:
```
musi ni li toki pakala lon toki sina nanpa wan!
This entertainment speaks mistakenly about your favorite language!
```
Here, we use toki pakala instead of toki lon/toki pi lon ala. There's only one more change I'd make, but it's purely for entertainment aesthetic and doesn't change the meaning:
```
toki sina nanpa wan la musi ni li toki pakala!
In the context of your favorite language, this entertainment speaks mistakenly!
```
Because honestly, the punch of ending on pakala is too good.

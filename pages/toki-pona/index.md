Toki Pona is an experience. Toki Pona is art. Toki Pona is many things to many
people. It is one of the most important things in my life. The passion put
forth by the community is unmatched, and I am thrilled to be a part of this
community every day.

Toki Pona is a thought exercise: how can you communicate using fewer than 150
unique words? You ask yourself, what is this object? What does this object mean
to me, and to my listener? You have to simplify, breaking down to only what is
required, and what is most important.

Toki Pona is a simplifier: once you break down an idea, it gets harder to
miscommunicate. In English, it is common to enter an argument and only later
realize the discussing parties were talking about different things despite
using the same word. In Toki Pona, this sort of miscommunication is rare.

Toki Pona is meditative: the mind is a complex world, and thoughts fly through
it at a moment's notice. Toki Pona is one tool among many that help you discern
what thoughts are important and what feelings are yours.

Before I discovered Toki Pona, I had made several attempts to learn other
languages in my life. None stuck until Toki Pona. Toki Pona gave me a language
I could understand, discuss, use, and be excited about. But most importantly,
Toki Pona gave me a bridge to learning other languages and a deeper
understanding of my communication that I would never have had without it.

I am creating a lesson series to go with my live lessons in VRChat. The written
and live lessons may not be identical: my live lessons are improvised from the
topic and a few examples to explore, and so may contain different content.

### kama sona

> %warning%
> These lessons are still in progress! They could change at any time.

kama sona is a lesson series about the core of Toki Pona. It is based on _Toki
Pona: The Language of Good_ and others' lessons, but with a focus on brevity,
accessibility, and what I felt I needed as a learner. I also have cut the
lesson list down to only **absolute essentials**, but I am making more lessons
to help your understanding outside these core lessons.

I highly recommend starting [a memrise
course](https://app.memrise.com/course/5969373/essential-toki-pona-vocabulary/)
at the same time as you start, to help you memorize all the words!

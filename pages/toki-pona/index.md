Toki Pona is an incredible experience. Nothing I can say here would compare to
the level of passion and effort put forth by the entire community, but allow me
to say: toki pona li pona tawa mi. toki pona li kama pona tawa sina.

Toki Pona presents a fascinating thought exercise: how can you communicate
using fewer than 150 unique words? You have to answer the question one of two
ways: what is this object? Or, what does this object mean to myself and the
person I'm speaking to? Toki Pona encourages you to simplify, and invite
context in for a drink.

You can start learning the vocab with jan Sonja's [memrise
course](https://app.memrise.com/course/5969373/), go to the [official
website](https://tokipona.org/) for some resources and discussion, or check out
[a ton of fascinating tools](http://tokipona.net/tp/default.aspx) the community
has created.

Before I discovered Toki Pona, I had made several attempts to learn other
languages in my life. None stuck until Toki Pona. Toki Pona gave me a language
I could understand, discuss, use, and be excited about. But most importantly,
Toki Pona gave me a bridge to learning other languages and a deeper
understanding of my communication that I would never have had without it.

I am planning to add some tools to this page in the near future. Stay tuned!

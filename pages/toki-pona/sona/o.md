Don’t worry, these are content words too! I separated them to make them easier to remember.

## Overview

#### Instructions

We’re going to look at another new sentence! We'll use the particle `o`, so we can give instructions or set out requirements.

The particle `o` is like `li`. It takes the same place in the sentence, but it changes the meaning: now, the sentence is an instruction!

You may give instructions without a subject, which are directed at the listener:

<details><summary>o lukin e kulupu kasi</summary>

Look at the forest.

Look at the garden.

</details>

This is the most common form of an instruction, _without_ a subject.

::: info

In Toki Pona, it is not rude to give an instruction. If you say “o ni” as in “Do this”, it is as polite as “Can you please do this?” in English. There is no “please” in Toki Pona, and no need for it!

:::

You may also give instructions to a specific subject:

<details><summary> jan lili o musi nasa ala </summary>

**If jan lili is listening**: Child, stop being silly!

**If jan lili is not listening**: The child has to stop being silly.

</details>

If the subject is not listening or not able to listen, you would interpret the statement as a requirement instead of a given instruction.

<details><summary> lipu o pakala ala </summary>

The paper must not be torn.

The documents must not be shredded.

</details>

This also applies to inanimate things! What does it mean to give instructions or requirements to a building, collection, light, or colors?

You can also reword these as instructions:

<details><summary> o pakala ala e lipu </summary>

Do not tear the paper.

Do not shred the documents.

</details>

Now the listener is responsible for the paper!

<details><summary> A note about politeness </summary>

It is possible to be rude in Toki Pona, as it is possible in any language. But in English, we soften requests with lots of extra words, such as please and can. In Toki Pona, there is an assumption that you are being earnest and respectful of your listener, so a request doesn’t need to be softened with other words. This is often called a “polite default” assumption, but I call it an “earnest default.”

</details>

#### Attention

You may use `o` directly after a subject phrase to get that subject’s attention:

<details><summary> mama o! </summary>

Mom! [mom looks over]

Dad! [dad looks over]

</details>

::: info

This is an interjection, which we’ll learn more about in the next lesson!

:::

This may appear before or after a sentence, but both mean the same:

<details><summary> jan sona o, sina pona! </summary>

Teacher, you’re excellent!

</details>

<details><summary> sina pona, jan sona o! </summary>

You’re excellent, teacher!

</details>

Here, `jan sona o` is getting the attention of `jan sona`, and the speaker says a complete sentence directed at them. The order of these doesn’t matter, so do what feels right in the moment.

You can use this interjection with an instruction, so you know that an instruction will be heard by its intended listener:

<details><summary> jan ale o, o pana e lipu sina! </summary>

Everyone, please turn in your papers!

</details>

And you can put the two together, because an instruction with a subject can get the attention of that subject at the same time as instructing or requiring:

<details><summary> jan ale o pana e lipu sina! </summary>

Everyone, please turn in your papers!

Everyone must turn in their papers.

</details>

#### taso sentences

Sometimes you'll see `taso` at the start of a sentence. This is like saying "but" or "however," and is usually used before a _later_ sentence to connect two ideas.

<details><summary> mi kute e pakala. taso mi pona. </summary>

I heard something break. But I'm alright!

</details>

The first sentence establishes context, and the second provides some clarifying or contrary information.

For comparison, here is the second sentence without `taso`:

> mi kute e pakala. mi pona.

Without `taso`, the sentences are not as clearly related.

#### taso modifier

`taso` is a modifier the rest of the time, but only as the _last_ modifier of a phrase, affecting the entire phrase. Consider these examples:

<details><summary> kute **taso** li pona e sona sina. </summary>

(Only listening) can improve your understanding.

</details>

<details><summary> kute li pona **taso** e sona sina. </summary>

Listening will (only improve) your understanding.

</details>

<details><summary> kute li pona e sona sina **taso**. </summary>

Listening will improve (your understanding only).

</details>

#### taso head

taso can also be the head of a phrase, used as a normal content word:

<details><summary> taso li pona. </summary>

Being alone is good.

Exclusivity is good.

</details>

<details><summary> ona li kama taso. </summary>

They became alone.

</details>

## Exercises

::: info

In previous lessons, I gave many interpretations for each sentence. As these sentences get longer and more complex, I provide fewer or only one interpretation, but there are other interpretations; try thinking of a few!

:::

### Toki Pona to English

#### o for commands

You're on a camping trip in the hills of a huge mountain range, and have a ranger with you to help the trip and provide knowledge of nature! You get back to your camp one night before sunset, and find a bear digging through your food. Oh no, you've gotta stop it! But the ranger tells you in hushed but serious tone:

<details><summary> o utala ala e soweli! </summary>

Don’t attack the bear!

</details>

You’re on a boat with some friends, enjoying the sun and the wind. One of your friends has been intently watching over the side, waiting for… Something? Eventually, they call out to everyone to come look, because they spotted something! They say:

<details><summary> o lukin e kala suli! </summary>

Look at this huuuuge fish!

</details>

Your neighbor somehow caught a bird, put it in a box, and is planning to keep it. Oh no, the poor bird! You explain to them that birds want to fly and be free, and tell them:

<details><summary> o poki ala e waso! </summary>

Don't put the birds in a box!

</details>

You've been frustratedly working on a piece of art for some time. It's a painting you wanted to gift to your teacher, but you don't think it's coming out right and want to destroy it. You show it to one of your friends for advice, and they say:

<details><summary> **o moli ala e sitelen sina. ona li pona!** </summary>

Don't kill your painting. It's fantastic!

::: info

Here, the word **ona** refers back to an idea in the previous sentence: "sitelen sina". This is a common way to use **ona**!

:::

</details>

#### o with a subject

Your dad is leaving you at home while he runs errands. He wants you to clean the house, because you made a mess of the place not long ago, bringing in a bunch of branches from outside. He says to you:

<details><summary> palisa o jaki ala e tomo. o weka e palisa! </summary>

Sticks must not make the house gross. Remove the sticks!

</details>

You’ve been hanging out on the porch for too long, and you’ve started to notice lots of obnoxious bugs coming out as the sun sets. In your frustration, you yell out at the bugs:

<details><summary> pipi o weka! o moli! </summary>

Bugs, go away! Die!

Bugs have to go away! And die!

</details>

You're trying to play a board game with a group of friends, but only one of you knows the rules. The rest of you are sitting together, trying to make sense of the rules, when one of the group pipes up:

<details><summary> jan pi sona musi o pana e sona! </summary>

The person who knows about the game should explain!

</details>

You’re explaining the rules to the game: When the leader covers their eyes, everyone runs as fast as they can. When the leader opens their eyes, if anyone is seen moving they’re out! You explain:

<details><summary> ona ale o tawa ala! </summary>

They all must not move!

</details>

You're in a cooking competition! The dish on order: authentic pasta. When the order comes in, you think long and hard about it; there's a lot of competition. Your coach chimes in with similar thinking, saying:

<details><summary> pan sina o pona wawa! </summary>

Your pasta has to come out _amazingly_!

</details>

#### o for attention

You spotted a cute squirrel, and you’re trying to get its attention!

<details><summary> soweli o! </summary>

Hey squirrel!

</details>

You brought your friend out to birdwatch with you. They are much newer to the hobby than you, and keep scaring off birds with their calls:

<details><summary> waso o! </summary>

Hey bird!

</details>

Your pet lizard absolutely loves to eat lettuce, tearing right into it. You wanted to show off for some of your friends, but it seems your little lizard friend has stage fright: he won't eat in front of the crowd! You tell him gently:

<details><summary> o moku e kili, akesi lili o </summary>

Please eat the lettuce, little lizard

</details>

#### Sentence-start taso

You're discussing hobbies with a friend, especially when you like to work on your hobbies. Your friend is a morning person and loves feeling the sun as they're productive. You like the sun, but prefer to work in the dark when the moon is out. You tell them:

<details><summary> suno li pona. taso pimeja li pona e ken sitelen mi. </summary>

The sun is good, but darkness helps my writing ability.

---

- Sunlight is okay, but the shade improves my writing performance.
- Lights are wonderful, but I prefer no lights for my writing.

</details>

It's the middle of winter, and you've seen nothing but dreary gray skies for weeks. One day, the cloud cover finally breaks, opening up to reveal beautiful sunlight! You step outside to bask, but unfortunately, the air is still frigid around you. You remark to yourself:

<details><summary> mi pilin e suno. taso mi lete. </summary>

I feel the sunlight, but I feel cold.

</details>

You're a genius inventor, working on an amazing new tool: a working pair of wings you can strap to your back! When you come up with a working prototype, you demonstrate the invention in front of a crowd, explaining:

<details><summary> mi waso ala, taso mi ken tawa sewi </summary>

I am not a bird, but I can fly

</details>

#### Modifier taso

Your friend has become quite philosophical as of late, and has been throwing various statements in their new philosophical views your way for review. The most recent one seems rather obvious to you, but you don't let them know that. The statement:

<details><summary> **ala li pona taso.** </summary>

Nothing is exclusively good.

Nothingness is only good!

::: info

This statement has two possible interpretations, even in the given context! It could be saying that _no object exists which is entirely good_, or _nothingness itself is exclusively good_. Maybe your friend is wiser than you thought?

:::

</details>

Your friend is down-trodden, feeling rejected. They haven't been invited to any parties or events lately, and are worried that all their friends are abandoning them. As a way of lashing out, they insist their friends are the problem, but you console them with some helpful perspective:

<details><summary> jan pona sina li ike ala! ona li pali taso. ona li wile e sina </summary>

Your friends are not mean! They're only working. They want you.

</details>

### English to Toki Pona

<details><summary> I want the shiny black rock! </summary>

mi wile e kiwen pimeja suno!

mi wile e kiwen pimeja pona!

</details>

<details><summary> They only have their id card. </summary>

ona li jo e lipu ona taso.

ona li jo e lipu jan ona taso.

::: info

Here, if `jo` were `taso`, it would mean they only action they were taking is having their ID card. What is meant is that the only object they is their ID card!

:::

</details>

<details><summary> **Make them stop!** </summary>

o awen e ona!

::: info

**awen** can mean to continue, or to stop. Here, applying **awen** to **ona** makes them stop!

:::

</details>

## Takeaway

#### Giving Instructions

Toki Pona is _earnest_ by default. Giving somebody an instruction is not rude unless you are _very_ intentional about being rude. You can tell somebody what to do, and it's perfectly okay for them to say "mi ken ala" -> "I am unable to."

#### Grammar

You can optionally include `taso` before a sentence, which connects it to previous statements in a similar way to "but" or "however" in English.

> (taso) [subject] (li) [predicate] (e [object])

taso can be used at the end of a phrase to indicate that particular phrase is exclusive.

There's also a bit more freedom for what can go _around_ a sentence. You can interject subjects, followed by o, to indicate who should be listening!

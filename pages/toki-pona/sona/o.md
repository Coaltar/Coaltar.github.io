## Overview

#### Pre-predicates

#### taso

Sometimes you'll see `taso` at the start of a sentence. This is like saying "but" or "however," and is usually used before a _later_ sentence to connect two ideas.

<details><summary> mi kute e pakala. taso mi pona. </summary>

I heard something break. But I'm alright!

</details>

The first sentence establishes some context, and the second provides some clarifying or contrary information.

For comparison, here is the second sentence without `taso`.

> mi kute e pakala. mi pona.

The second sentence still provides clarifying info, but it now appears separate from the first sentence.

::: info

The subject rarely starts with taso, so you can easily tell subject taso from but/however taso.
If taso is the subject and modified, it could be hard to tell what the speaker means!

:::

`taso` is a (mostly) normal modifier the rest of the time! It does behave a little differently

## Exercises

### Toki Pona to English

You're discussing hobbies with a friend, especially when you like to work on your hobbies. Your friend is a morning person and loves feeling the sun as they're productive. You like the sun, but prefer to work in the dark when the moon is out. You tell them:

<details><summary> suno li pona. taso pimeja li pona e pali mi. </summary>

The sun is good, but darkness helps me work.

---

- Sunlight is okay, but the shade improves my productivity.
- Lights are wonderful, but I prefer no lights for my hobbies.

</details>

It's the middle of winter, and you've seen nothing but dreary gray skies for weeks. One day, the cloud cover finally breaks, opening up to reveal beautiful sunlight! You step outside to bask, but unfortunately, the air is still frigid around you. You remark to yourself:

<details><summary> mi pilin e suno. taso mi lete. </summary>

I feel the sunlight, but I feel cold.

---

</details>

Your friend has become quite philosophical as of late, and has been throwing various statements in their new philosophical views your way for review. The most recent one seems rather obvious to you, but you don't let them know that. The statement:

<details><summary> ala li pona taso. </summary>

Nothing is exclusively good.

Nothingness is only good!

::: info

This statement has two possible interpretations, even in the given context! It could be saying that _no object exists which is entirely good_, or _nothingness itself is exclusively good_.

:::

</details>

Your friend is down-trodden, feeling rejected. They haven't been invited to any parties or events lately, and are worried that all their friends are abandoning them. As a way of lashing out, they insist their friends are the problem, but you console them with some helpful perspective:

<details><summary> jan pona sina li ike ala! ona li pali taso. ona li wile e sina </summary>

Your friends are not mean! They're only working. They want you.

---

- Your teachers aren't bad. They're just busy. They need you!

</details>

### English to Toki Pona

<details><summary> I want the shiny black rock! </summary>

mi wile e kiwen pimeja suno!

mi wile e kiwen pimeja pona!

</details>

<details><summary> They only have their id card. </summary>

ona li jo taso e lipu ona.

ona li jo taso e lipu jan ona.

</details>

## Takeaway

#### Grammar

Also, you can optionally include `taso` before a sentence, which connects it to previous statements in a similar way to "but" or "however" in English.

> (taso) [subject] (li) [predicate] (e [object])

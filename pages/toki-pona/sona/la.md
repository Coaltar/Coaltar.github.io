## Overview

## Exercises / Examples

## Takeaway

la is providing context, and it comes in two forms

1. incomplete sentences (phrases, individual words):
   pona la mi pini e pali mi
   these can be conditional but more frequently are more like the literal interpretation: in the context of (before la), (after la)
   so here, this is like "in the context of good, I finish my work"

2. complete sentences:
   jan li pona la, mi wile lon poka ona
   these are much more frequently some kind of conditional, but they can just be context too. this one is a conditional:
   "if people are good, I want to be at their side"

but! don't worry much about not getting la yet! it is the most complex part of toki pona's grammar, and while that isn't saying much, it is still nuanced. it probably took me two months of regular practice to really feel like i understood la.

## Overview

#### Interjections we know

In Toki Pona, there are many ways to express yourself that are not complete sentences! We've already seen two of these: `toki` is not a complete sentence, but you use it to say hello! And you can use `[name] o` to get somebody or something's attention. But is there more?

Yes! For this lesson, I set

#### o-alikes / well-wishes

`o`-alikes are a collection of interjections which are similar to instructions given with `o`, but not having `o`. They are often called "well-wishes", because the most common of these end in `pona`! Some examples:

> [tawa pona]{.tokipona}

> [awen pona]{.tokipona}

> [musi pona]{.tokipona}

These all have similar meanings: Do something in a good way! "Go well", "stay well", and "have fun well" respectively. You'll see these used in response to goodbyes, such as in this exchange:

> [mi tawa]{.tokipona}
>
> > [tawa pona]{.tokipona}
> >
> > > [aãƒ»awen pona]{.tokipona}

It is also common to include `o`, making complete sentences while keeping the well-wishing meaning.

#### Emotes

Emotes are are emotionally charged, expressing the excitement, interest,

The most common of these is `a`, which could mean anything!

Consider these exchanges:

> [mi pali e ]{.tokipona}
>
> > [a]{.tokipona}

#### Remarks

Remarks are a broad category where the speaker is expressing their opinion about something! These are similar to the sentence `ni li [thing]`, but expressing only the predicate to say `[thing]`. Here are some examples:

<details><summary> [ni li suwi]{.tokipona} </summary>
</details>

#### Acknowledgement

#### In future lessons

We'll learn about answers to questions in a coming lesson, and that will be the last kind of interjection!

- emotives (mu, wawa, a, pona)
- acknowledgements (a, pona, sona, lon, kin, sama)
- command-alikes (tawa pona, musi pona, awen pona)
- remarks (pona, suwi mute) [like being implicitly lead by 'ni li']
- attention getting

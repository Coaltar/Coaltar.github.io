Not many words this time! Instead, we'll be looking at a bunch of words from before in new ways.

## Overview

#### Interjections

In Toki Pona, there are many things to say that are not complete sentences; interjections! [toki]{.tokipona} says "hello", and a subject plus [o]{.tokipona} gets that subject's attention. But there's more!

Anything that can be a subject, predicate, object, or preposition with prep phrase can be an interjection! Some of these can even be used together.

But some words and phrases do better than others. To make this point, I've broken down interjections into a few common uses.

Before we start, let's talk about [a]{.tokipona}!

#### a, the interjection that ever

[a]{.tokipona} is a special word. It has no meaning like particles, but it also doesn't do anything to a sentence. It's just [a]{.tokipona}! This means you can use it however you feel, as both an interjection and a modifier.

Since [a]{.tokipona} can be used so many ways, we'll look at a few examples:

> [mi kama jo e lipu a]{.tokipona}
>
> > [a!]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: I got a cool book!

2: Ooooh! [excitement]

</details>

> [soweli mi li weka a]{.tokipona}
>
> > [a...]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: My dog ran away...

2: Oh... [empathy]

</details>

> [mi sona ala a e toki sina]{.tokipona}
>
> > [a...]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: I _really_ don't understand what you're saying

2: Hmmm... [thinking]

</details>

For all of these, the tone is important! Not everyone's tone will be the same when speaking, either. But this is far from everything that [a]{.tokipona} can do. Try lots of things!

::: info

Sometimes you'll hear "**nnn**" instead of "**aaa**". This comes from the word [n]{.tokipona}, which works like "hmm" or "uh" in English! It's less common than [a]{.tokipona}, so it is not in this lesson, but you may see and hear it around.

:::

#### o-alikes / well-wishes

[o]{.tokipona}-alikes are similar to instructions given with [o]{.tokipona}, but without [o]{.tokipona}. You could call them "well-wishes", because the most common of these end in or have [pona]{.tokipona}! Some examples:

<details><summary> [tawa pona]{.tokipona} </summary>

Go well!

Be happy as you leave!

</details>

<details><summary> [musi pona]{.tokipona} </summary>

Have fun!

Be happy as you play!

</details>

These two are similar: Do something in a good way! You'll see these used in response to goodbyes.

<details><summary> [pona tawa sina]{.tokipona} </summary>

Goodness, go to you!

Peace be upon you!

</details>

This one is also a well-wish, but includes the preposition [tawa]{.tokipona}.

You can choose to include [o]{.tokipona} where it makes sense, making these complete sentences while keeping the well-wishing meaning:

> [o tawa pona]{.tokipona}

> [o musi pona]{.tokipona}

> [pona o tawa sina]{.tokipona}

These versions could be instructions or well wishes. It's all about context!

Try lots of different things! As long as your listener understands what you mean, you're speaking Toki Pona.

Here's an example exchange to fit the idea in a conversation:

> 1: [mi tawa]{.tokipona}
>
> > 2: [tawa pona]{.tokipona}
> >
> > > 1: [a・awen pona]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: I'm going!

2: Go well!

1: Yeah! Stay well!

---

The above is a literal translation, so here is a comparable conversation but written in more natural English:

1: I'm headed out!

2: See you later!

1: Yeah! See you!

</details>

#### Feelings, Opinions, and Remarks

Most other interjections are specific words! Their meaning as an interjection comes from their usual meaning. We already saw that [a]{.tokipona} can be used for any feeling, but words like [sona, wawa, musi]{.tokipona}, and others can do specific feelings: Excitement, interest, happiness, fear, anger, sadness, and everything between!

These can also be used to express how you feel about a situation, similar to saying `ni li [word]`, or `pilin mi li [word]`.

And they can be used to respond in a conversation, which

Here's a bunch of common use examples. This is not a complete list, and it doesn't cover every way you could use these words. But it does cover a lot of common uses. Try lots of things!

> [mu]{.tokipona}

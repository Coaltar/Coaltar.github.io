## Overview

#### Proper Names

::: info

Toki Pona has a way to use names, but try _not_ using them. You'll learn a lot!

:::

In Toki Pona, you can refer to things by their name. To do this, you start with describing the thing. What kind of thing is this? Languages are `toki`, games are `musi`, and people are usually `jan`! Then you can use the name right after, like any kind of modifier.

<details><summary> mi lon ma Kanse! </summary>

I'm in France!

</details>

When written in latin characters, proper names are always capitalized at the start.

<details><summary> [mi lon ma [kiwen alasa nasin sewi esun]]{.tokipona} </summary>

I'm in France!

</details>

In `sitelen pona`, proper names are written in a box, then spelled by reading the first letter of each symbol in the box. Here we spell out `Kanse`, which is what France is called in Toki Pona!

::: info

Toki Pona lets people and places name themselves! For example, Japan is called "にほん (Nihon)" by Japanese speakers, so in Toki Pona, Japan is called **ma Nijon**.

:::

#### Numbers

::: info

Toki Pona has numbers, but they aren't important! If there are lots of things, use **mute**. If there are a few things, try **mute lili**, or nothing at all! Numbers aren't important in Toki Pona.

:::

Toki Pona has two numbers: `wan` and `tu`. If you read those out, it should sound like the same numbers from English: one (1) and two (2).

<details><summary> [o kama jo e ilo tu wan]{.tokipona} </summary>

Pick up three (3, 2+1) tools.

Go get three (3, 2+1) tools.

</details>

When counting things, you use numbers as modifiers. So in this example, `tu wan` is like having a modifier that means "three."

`wan` is one, `tu` is two, `tu wan` is three, `tu tu` is four, and `tu tu wan` is five. This keeps going, which gets long quickly! Try `mute` instead of a bunch of `tu` and `wan`.

By the way: `wan` and `tu` are normal content words with meanings besides numbers:

<details><summary> [mi wan e lipu ale]{.tokipona} </summary>

I combined all the papers.

I united all the documents.

</details>

<details><summary> [soweli li tu e moku tawa pana]{.tokipona} </summary>

The animal divided up the food to gift.

The critter split up the food to give away.

</details>

You can also use the word `nanpa` to rank things. `nanpa wan` is often used to refer to favorites, like this:

<details><summary> [ni li pona nanpa wan tawa mi]{.tokipona} </summary>

This is my favorite!

This is the best good thing, to me!

</details>

For this, `nanpa` works like `pi` because it groups the words after it into one modifier. But the new modifier is a rank, like "first" or "third!"

---

If you _really, really_ want to use bigger and more specific numbers, there is a system with more numbers than one and two.

Counting with this system works exactly as before, except you have bigger numbers to use:

<!-- this is a hack lmao -->

| Glyph | Word | Number            |
| ----- | ---- | ----------------- |
| wan   | wan  | One (1)           |
| tu    | tu   | Two (2)           |
| luka  | luka | Five (5)          |
| mute  | mute | Twenty (20)       |
| ale   | ale  | One Hundred (100) |

:::

Here are some quick examples:

<details><summary> [sina jo e kasi mute luka tu]{.tokipona} </summary>

You have twenty seven (27, 20+5+2) plants.

</details>

<details><summary> [jan ale ale wan li lon]{.tokipona} </summary>

There are two hundred and one (201, 100+100+1) people here.

</details>

<details><summary> [mi lukin e lipu luka luka luka]{.tokipona} </summary>

I've read fifteen (15, 5+5+5) books.

</details>

#### Interjections

In Toki Pona, there are many things to say that are not complete sentences! `toki` says "hello", and a subject plus `o` gets that subject's attention, as we saw before. There's a bunch more, too.

Anything that can be a subject, predicate, object, or preposition with prep phrase can be an interjection! Some of these can even be used together.

While most things can be interjections, some words are better than others for this. To make this point, I've broken down interjections into a few common uses.

Before we start, let's talk about `a`!

##### a, the word that ever

`a` is a special word. It has no meaning like particles, but it also doesn't do anything to a sentence. It's just `a`! This means you can use it however you feel, as both an interjection and a modifier.

Since `a` can be used so many ways, we'll look at a few examples:

> [mi kama jo e lipu a]{.tokipona}
>
> > [a!]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: I got a cool book!

2: Ooooh! [excitement]

</details>

> [soweli mi li weka a]{.tokipona}
>
> > [a...]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: My dog ran away...

2: Oh... [empathy]

</details>

> [mi sona ala a e toki sina]{.tokipona}
>
> > [a...]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: I _really_ don't understand what you're saying

2: Hmmm... [thinking]

</details>

This is far from everything that `a` can do. Try lots of things!

::: info

Sometimes you'll hear "**nnn**" instead of "**aaa**". This comes from the word [n]{.tokipona}, which works like "hmm" or "uh" in English! It's less common than [a]{.tokipona}, so it is not in this lesson, but you may see and hear it around.

:::

##### Emotes, Remarks, Acknowledgements

<!-- Interjections have many different uses. `a` can do anything as an interjection, but other words are more focused because of the meaning they normally have. -->

Emotes are all about feelings! Excitement, interest, happiness, fear, anger, sadness, and everything between. [mu]{.tokipona}

Remarks are for expressing your opinion about something! These are similar to saying `ni li [word]`, or `pilin mi li [word]`. [wawa]{.tokipona}

<!-- The interjection works a lot like a predicate! -->

Acknowledgements are for letting somebody know that you're listening. They often work like remarks, giving some of your opinion! [sona]{.tokipona}

We already saw that [a]{.tokipona} can do all of these, but there are many words you can use to express your feelings. Here are some rapid fire examples:

> [o pali e ni]{.tokipona}
>
> > [a・mi pali]{.tokipona}
> >
> > > [pona]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: Can you make this?

2: Yeah, I'll make it

1: Great, thanks!

</details>

`pona` interjection is to express that something is good! It works like "great", "cool" or "nice" in English.

---

> [mi ken ala kute e jan poka tan kalama suli... ike!]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

I can't hear the person beside me because of all the loud noise. Oh no!

</details>

`ike` interjection is like saying "oh no" or "oof" in English, expressing your dislike for something.

---

> [mi weka e lipu sona mi... pakala!]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

I lost my textbook. Crap!

</details>

`pakala` interjection is like saying "crud" or "oops" in English, expressing your feelings about a mistake or accident.

---

> [kala ni li suwi a・o lukin!]{.tokipona}
>
> > [a a a suwi]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: This fish is cute! Look!

2: Hahaha, it is cute!

</details>

`suwi` interjection is used to say that something is cute, soft, or sweet, just like `suwi` itself.

---

> [mi suli e kulupu kasi mi lon tenpo lili taso]{.tokipona}
>
> > [wawa!]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: I made my garden grow big in only a little time!

2: Wow!

</details>

`wawa` interjection is used to express amazement, especially at the skill or strength of something.

---

> []{.tokipona}
>
> > [musi a!]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: I made my garden grow big in only a little time!

2: Hilarious!

</details>

`musi` interjection is used to express excitement or humor!

---

> [sina ken kepeken ilo ni tawa pali tomo]{.tokipona}
>
> > [sona!]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: You can use this tool for building homes.

2: Got it!

</details>

`sona` interjection is used to express understanding of a previous statement.

---

> [pilin mi li musi a tan telo ni...]{.tokipona}
>
> > [sama]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: I'm feeling super entertained because of this liquid!

2: Same!

</details>

`sama` interjection is to say that you do or feel similarly to something that was previously stated.

---

> [sina toki lon tenpo suli. sina ken lili e tenpo toki]{.tokipona}
>
> > [lon]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: You spoke for a long time. You can reduce the time you spend talking!

2: True.

</details>

`lon` interjection is to indicate the truth of something. It's like saying "true" or "agreed" in English.

> [mu]{.tokipona}

`mu` is Toki Pona's word for any animal sound- as an interjection, it tells you the speaker is having fun!

::: info

This is not a complete list of interjections, just some of them! Try out lots more.

:::

##### o-alikes / well-wishes

`o`-alikes are interjections similar to instructions given with `o`, but without `o`. You could call them "well-wishes", because the most common of these end in or have `pona`! Some examples:

<details><summary> [tawa pona]{.tokipona} </summary>

Go well!

Be happy as you leave!

</details>

<details><summary> [musi pona]{.tokipona} </summary>

Have fun!

Be happy as you play!

</details>

These two are similar: Do something in a good way! You'll see these used in response to goodbyes.

<details><summary> [pona tawa sina]{.tokipona} </summary>

Goodness, go to you!

Peace be upon you!

</details>

This one is also a well-wish, but includes the preposition `tawa`.

You can choose to include `o` where it makes sense, making these complete sentences while keeping the well-wishing meaning.

> [o tawa pona]{.tokipona}

> [o musi pona]{.tokipona}

> [pona o tawa sina]{.tokipona}

Again, try lots of different things! So long as your listener understands what you mean, you're speaking Toki Pona.

## Exercises

::: info

Interjections are best understood as part of conversations, so the exercises are different for this lesson. The conversation will be shown above, and the translation will be in a spoiler below.

:::

### Toki Pona to English

You and a friend are hanging out their house, when you realize it's getting late and you go home. You let your friend know:

> 1: [mi tawa]{.tokipona}
>
> > 2: [tawa pona]{.tokipona}
> >
> > > 1: [a・awen pona]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: I'm going!

2: Go well!

1: Yeah! Stay well!

---

The above is a literal translation, so here is a comparable conversation but written in more natural English:

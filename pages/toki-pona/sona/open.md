## How to Read

If you know the International Phonetic Alphabet, Toki Pona is read like that.
If you don't, the vowels are like Spanish, Italian, Esperanto, or long vowels in Latin; the consonants are
like English except `j` which makes a `y` sound. If you don't know the vowels
in the listed languages, I have a guide below. Also, the first syllable of a word
is always emphasized, and the others are not.

What I described above is good enough- but there's more detail if you're interested!

The sounds of Toki Pona can be subtly different in a variety of ways. For example, the nasal `n` that can end syllables is intended to be in the same part of the mouth as the consonant that follows it- `[tenpo]` becomes `/tempo/`, and `[ilo Linku]` becomes `/ilo Liŋku/` (`ilo Lingku`). Additionally, Toki Pona: The Language of Good notes that some of the vowels are not _exactly_ as in the International Phonetic Alphabet, such as `[a]` actually being realized as `/ä/`- but this book documents jan Sonja's own use of Toki Pona, so don't worry about it too much! So long as you speak clearly and consistently enough to be understood, you'll be fine.

You should also _listen_ to Toki Pona. Do so

understanding yet!

### Vowels

These are _close_ but not exact. They may change because of accent too. Listen
to Toki Pona to be sure!

| vowel | sound     |
| ----- | --------- |
| [a]   | c**a**r   |
| [e]   | b**e**st  |
| [i]   | wh**ee**l |
| [o]   | r**o**w   |
| [u]   | m**oo**n  |

### Consonants

| consonant | sound      |
| --------- | ---------- |
| [k]       | **k**ind   |
| [j]       | **y**ear   |
| [l]       | **l**ess   |
| [m]       | **m**ark   |
| [n]       | **n**ose   |
| [p]       | **p**lease |
| [s]       | **s**ave   |
| [t]       | **t**alk   |
| [w]       | **w**est   |

### Syllables

In Toki Pona, syllables can start with a vowel at the start of words, and
can start with consonants anywhere. Here are all possible syllable
types:

- a single vowel (**e**sun)
- a vowel and n (**an**pa)
- a consonant and vowel (**ka**la)
- a consonant, vowel, and n (**ten**po)

And here are all possible syllables:

|  -  |  j  |  k  |  l  |  m  |  n  |  p  |  s  |  t  |  w  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  a  | ja  | ka  | la  | ma  | na  | pa  | sa  | ta  | wa  |
|  e  | je  | ke  | le  | me  | ne  | pe  | se  | te  | we  |
|  i  |     | ki  | li  | mi  | ni  | pi  | si  |     | wi  |
|  o  | jo  | ko  | lo  | mo  | no  | po  | so  | to  |     |
|  u  | ju  | ku  | lu  | mu  | nu  | pu  | su  | tu  |     |

<!-- | an  | jan | kan | lan | man | nan | pan | san | tan | wan | -->
<!-- | en  | jen | ken | len | men | nen | pen | sen | ten | wen | -->
<!-- | in  |     | kin | lin | min | nin | pin | sin |     | win | -->
<!-- | on  | jon | kon | lon | mon | non | pon | son | ton |     | -->
<!-- | un  | jun | kun | lun | mun | nun | pun | sun | tun |     | -->

<!-- For reference, the banned syllables have some common rules for transformation: -->

<!-- | before | after | -->
<!-- | ------ | ----- | -->
<!-- | wu     | u     | -->
<!-- | wo     | o     | -->
<!-- | ji     | i     | -->
<!-- | ti     | si    | -->

<!-- But these are not the _only_ ways to realize these syllables; you can change -->
<!-- the vowel or consonant in any way to produce a more fitting sound. -->

Each of these may be followed with `n` as well.

These syllables are not allowed, and so not given:

- wu
- wo
- ji
- ti

Also,

- You can't have vowels side by side
- You can't have `n` next to `m` or `n`

## How to Write

### sitelen Lasina - "Latin writing"

With latin characters, Toki Pona is written without capital letters except for
proper nouns such as names of people, places, and languages. This includes the
start of sentences. Example:

> sina wile lon poka mi la mi tu li tawa ma Sonko

There are no rules for punctuation, but it is common to end sentences with
`.` or `!`, questions with `?`, and other sentences with `:`. It is also common to use `,` to indicate natural pauses.

> jan li toki e ni: seme li lon? ona li wile tawa, li wile lape.

For now, don't worry about punctuation much!

## sitelen pona - "good writing"

Toki Pona can also be written with a system known as sitelen pona. It assigns
one character per word, which is convenient when you have few words! sitelen
pona is not required for learning Toki Pona, but I highly recommend it and provide it with all new words.

In sitelen pona, it is common to use an interpunct `・` to mark the end of sentences, in addition to all the punctuation used in sitelen Lasina. Some writers will also start brand new lines.

::: tokipona

> jan li toki e ni・seme li lon・ona li wile tawa li wile lape

:::

Also, proper nouns are written inside a cartouche, which can be just brackets or an entire enclosed square around the symbols. Everything inside the cartouche is read by only its first character:

::: tokipona

> sina wile lon poka mi la mi tu li tawa ma [sitelen olin nasin kasi open]

:::

Lastly, symbols can be stacked or nested! Stacked symbols are read from the bottom up, and nested symbols are read from the outside in.

::: tokipona

> toki-pona li pona mute tawa mi・toki ni la nasin sitelen li linja-suwi ala

:::

Again, don't worry about _all_ this just yet! You'll find what feels comfortable for you as you learn.

## Other Notes

The definitions given for words are _not_ comprehensive, and cannot be. The same goes for the exercises in every lesson. Instead, each is a list of possible meanings and a list of examples- words and phrases encompass far more than the examples can cover! Try to think of more things you could refer to with each word as you learn.

Also, if you ever see a spoiler starting with "a note", it is not necessary to read. But it might still be helpful!

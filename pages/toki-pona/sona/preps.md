#### Prepositions

::: tpdefinitions

| Glyph   | Word    | Definition                            |
| ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| tawa    | tawa    | to, travel to, for, in the opinion of |
| lon     | lon     | in the context of, in the presence of |
| tan     | tan     | by, from, because of                  |
| sama    | sama    | similar to                            |
| kepeken | kepeken | to use                                |

Take a close look: `kepeken` is exclusively a preposition!

## Overview

Prepositions are words that add a phrase worth of context to a sentence. The term "preposition" comes from these words marking "positions" in time and place- the "pre" part is for the fact that these words come before positions!

Toki Pona's prepositions are not all about position, but several are, and the logic works the same. Prepositions introduce a new phrase of context for a sentence.

#### Every Preposition

tawa

---

lon

---

tan

---

sama

---

kepeken

#### "Modifying" prepositions

You cannot modify a preposition,

#### Multiple prepositions

When a prepositional phrase is complete, you can start another one. You can do this as many times as you want, but using fewer is more clear and understandable.

## Exercises

### Toki Pona to English

### English to Toki Pona

As with the preverbs, there are two separate example groups that use the new words in different ways!

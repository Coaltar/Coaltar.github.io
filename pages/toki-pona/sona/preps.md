Take a close look: `kepeken` is only a preposition!

## Overview

Prepositions add context to a sentence. When using a preposition, you say the word and a phrase following it- the phrase is the context, and the word tells you what kind of context it is!

The term "preposition" comes from these words marking times and place- the "pre" part is for the fact that these words come before positions.

::: info

Focus on **where the preposition is** in the next few sentences!

:::

A preposition may appear after the object:

> [suno li walo e kiwen <u>**tawa lukin**</u>]{.tokipona}

After the predicate, without an object:

> [kasi li kama wawa <u>**tan telo pona**</u>]{.tokipona}

Or right after `li` as the predicate:

> [ona li <u>**sama mi**</u>]{.tokipona}

Prepositions always appear **last** in a statement. Keep that in mind!

#### Every Preposition

---

##### tawa

`tawa` is all about context, so watch carefully!

`tawa` can describe moving toward a specific place or thing:

<details><summary> [mi <u>**tawa telo suli**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

I'm traveling **to the ocean**!

</details>

<details><summary> [ona li pana e sona <u>**tawa jan ante**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

They gave knowledge **to different people**.

</details>

`tawa` can describe perspective, like English "to": description from the point of view of something or someone!

<details><summary> [ni li pona mute <u>**tawa mi**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

This is fantastic **to me**!

This is so good **in my opinion**!

</details>

<details><summary> [kasi ni li suli <u>**tawa jan**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

This plant is huge **to people**!

This plant is huge **compared to people**!

</details>

And `tawa` can describe purpose, like English "for": doing an action on something or someone's behalf.

<details><summary> [jan li pali e ni <u>**tawa sona**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

The person created this **for understanding**!

</details>

<details><summary> [mi ni <u>**tawa ona**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

I did this **for them**.

</details>

You can tell these different uses of `tawa` apart by context. For example, if the speaker is explaining why they did something, that would be about purpose. Or, if the speaker is giving their opinion, that would be about perspective. You'll get used to these different ideas as you practice!

---

##### lon

`lon` is used for location, telling where or when something is!

This can be a place:

<details><summary> [kulupu li <u>**lon kiwen suli**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

The group is **on the big rocks**!

</details>

It can also be about time, when or for how long something happens.
This uses one new word besides `lon`, `tenpo`:

<details><summary> [suno li <u>**lon tenpo suli**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

The sun has existed **for a long time**.

It will be sunny **for a long time**!

</details>

And it can be semantic, such as in ideas:

<details><summary> [mi toki <u>**lon sona ma mi**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

I am talking **about my knowledge of places**!

I am talking **about my understanding of dirt**.

</details>

All of these are different kinds of locations. Try lots of things out!

---

##### tan

`tan` indicates the cause of or reason for something. It's similar to "from" or "because of" in English.

<details><summary> [mi wawa <u>**tan moku pona**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

I'm strong because of good food!

</details>

This can describe some kinds of motion, or just be explanatory:

<details><summary> [mi <u>**tan kulupu suli**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

I'm from a huge community!

I'm here from a huge community!

</details>

::: warning

Remember: **tawa** talks about purpose, while **tan** talks about cause. To tell them apart, ask yourself: is one making the other happen? If so, that's **tan**!

:::

---

##### sama

`sama` says that something is similar to something else. This may be to compare the subject to something:

<details><summary> [pali mani sina li <u>**sama mama mi**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

Your work is similar to my mom's!

You do the same job as my dad!

</details>

Or to compare the subject's action to something:

<details><summary> [ona li ken tawa wawa <u>**sama jan wawa**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

They can move quickly, like a sprinter!

They can move powerfully, like a weight-lifter!

</details>

`sama` covers all kinds of sameness- a little similar, identical, and everything between!

---

##### kepeken

<details><summary> [jan li pali e ma kasi <u>**kepeken ilo**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

The people are creating a garden **using tools**.

</details>

`kepeken` means "to use". The thing in a `kepeken` prep phrase is being used by the subject. That's it!

<!-- #### "Modifying" prepositions -->
<!-- You cannot modify a preposition. However, you can apply pre-predicates to prepositions: -->
<!-- ona li awen pana tawa sina -->
<!-- they're still giving to you -->
<!-- And you can modify prepositions with other parts -->

---

Now that we've covered all the prepositions, here are some important notes about using them!

#### Multiple prepositions

When a prepositional phrase is complete, you can start another one. You can do this as many times as you want, but fewer is clearer. Some examples:

<details><summary> [ona li kama jo e pan suwi <u>**tan jan pi pali moku**</u>, <u>**tawa pilin pona**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

They received some cake **from a baker**, **to feel better**

</details>

<details><summary> [pilin mi li kama pona <u>**tan lape**</u>, <u>**tan tawa telo**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

My feelings have gotten better **from sleeping** and **from swimming**.

</details>

<details><summary> [ona li toki <u>**lon lape ona**</u>, <u>**sama mama pi jan mi**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

They talk **in their sleep**, **same as my partner's dad!**

They talk **when napping**, **like my friend's mom!**

</details>

Otherwise, the rules are the same as with just one preposition!

::: warning

The commas are present to separate the two prepositions. They aren't needed!

:::

#### ala and prepositions

You can negate prepositions by putting `ala` after the preposition.

<details><summary> [mama kasi li <u>**tawa ala sina**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

The gardener is **not coming to you**.

The plant's parent is **not going over to you**!

</details>

<details><summary> [jan pali li <u>**kepeken ala lipu ni**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

The workers are not using this document!

</details>

This is so simple, you already got it!

<details><summary>A note about negating things other than prepositions</summary>

Negating the subject (**jan ala li ...**) and negating the prepositional phrase (**... tan sona ala**) can give you a similar result to negating the preposition. **_Can_**.

Most of the time, it makes things confusing! What does it mean when **jan ala li kepeken sona**? Or when **mi tawa musi sama sina ala**?

The first is something like "Not-people" or "Non-persons" use knowledge. And the second is "I dance the same way as not-you." These are confusing!

</details>

::: info

Stick to negating **predicates**, **modifiers**, **pre-predicates**, or **prepositions**. Clean and clear!

## Exercises

### Toki Pona to English

#### One Preposition

You're walking through a convention center, when somebody runs up and says hi! They know you from your outreach work, and are excited to meet you. They open up with:

<details><summary> [sina tan kulupu pi jan pana]{.tokipona} </summary>

You're from the philanthropy community!

</details>

You're on a tour of a factory, watching how various household objects get made. As you walk, you observe marvelous machinery working hard- and then come across one machine in particular wielding another machine! You remark:

<details><summary> [ilo li pali e supa kepeken ilo ante]{.tokipona} </summary>

The machine is creating furniture using other machines!

</details>

You have been using a new studying method for school work. The way it helps you dig through material is clear and concise, and you always feel like you have a good grasp on the concepts after. You recommend it to others, saying:

<details><summary> [nasin sona ni li pona tawa sona jan]{.tokipona} </summary>

This learning method is great for people's understanding.

</details>

Every time you try to take a vacation, something comes up and you have to cancel. It's like the universe is conspiring against you. You've been planning a trip to the Bahamas for months, but your boss said you can't take the time off. You're starting to think they're doing it on purpose. You think to yourself:

<details><summary> [mi pali lon tenpo mute・mi wile tawa ma ante]{.tokipona} </summary>

I work too much. I want to go somewhere different!

</details>

Your friend has been reading somebody's blog, and feeding you hints as to its topic as they go. You're not sure what it's about, and your friend won't tell you no matter how much you ask! Until one day, barely stifling a chuckle, they tell you:

<details><summary> [ma li supa sama supa moku]{.tokipona} </summary>

The earth is flat like a dinner plate!

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_DfpQTRvyc>

</details>

<details><summary> []{.tokipona} </summary>

</details>

<details><summary> []{.tokipona} </summary>

</details>

Your teacher is emphasizing the relative size of the earth in comparison to other objects. This is an important idea for students to understand, because it helps them to put the earth's size into perspective. It also helps them to understand that the earth is a huge object, and that it is much larger than any one person. Your teacher says:

<details><summary> [ma li suli ala tawa sewi・ona li suli tawa jan]{.tokipona} </summary>

The earth isn't large compared to the sky. It's large compared to people.

</details>

#### Multiple Prepositions

You're back home again, feeling great because of your trip, but there's one thing wrong: you have a limp! You're in too good a mood to let it get you down, but one of your friends asked what happened. You explain:

<details><summary> [mi pilin ike tan tawa anpa lon tenpo poka]{.tokipona} </summary>

I'm feeling bad because I fell down recently.

</details>

A close friend is going on a long trip, and doesn't know when they'll be back. They gave you something important to them- a bracelet they'd had for years. You try to refuse it, saying it's too important to them to give away. But your friend insists, saying:

<details><summary> [mi pana e ni tawa sina tan wile mi]{.tokipona} </summary>

I'm giving this to you because I wanted to.

</details>

After quitting your job, you find yourself with brand new freedom. You cut down your expenses, sell some stuff, and start traveling with the saved money. When you get to your first destination, you realize something even better with great excitement! In a shocked, hushed tone you say:

<details><summary> [mi ken lon ma ale lon tenpo ale]{.tokipona} </summary>

I can be in any place, at any time!

</details>

<details><summary> []{.tokipona} </summary>

</details>

<details><summary> []{.tokipona} </summary>

</details>

<details><summary> []{.tokipona} </summary>

</details>

#### Preps and ala

You're sitting in class, learning about how plants have adapted to a variety of different environments. However, there are some environments that plants haven't adapted to, such as the cold and thin air on tall mountains! The teacher says:

<details><summary> [kasi li lon ala ma sewi]{.tokipona} </summary>

Plants aren't on ground that is way high up!

</details>

You're watching a storm roll in. The wind is whipping past you at an alarming speed! As the storm inches closer, the wind picks up more, blowing the plants and the trees around in vicious circles. As you watch, you notice the shrubs and grasses being blown over without resistance, then rising back up. But the trees have their branches torn away. You remark:

<details><summary> [kasi lili li sama ala kasi suli]{.tokipona} </summary>

The shrubs and grasses are not similar to the trees.

</details>

<details><summary> []{.tokipona} </summary>

## Takeaway

#### Grammar

Prepositions extend the grammar a bit! You can now include a new phrase at the end of the sentence, or as soon as the predicate. Here are some examples of this idea:

> [subject] (li) (preposition [prep phrase])

> [subject] (li) [predicate] (e [object]) (preposition [prep phrase])

> [subject] (li) [predicate] (preposition [prep phrase])

Keep in mind: if a preposition comes right after `li` it's still the predicate!

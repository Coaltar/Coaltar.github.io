One word here is a particle _and_ content word! You'll be able to tell these apart by how the word is used.

## Overview

#### One Modifier

In Toki Pona, words may be _modified_ by adding words after the first in a phrase. This first word is known as the **Head**, or sometimes **Head Noun**. Every word after the head is a **Modifier**. Here's an example of a phrase:

<details><summary>lipu musi</summary>

- Joke book
- Fun paper
- Entertaining document

</details>

The first word is the most important, because it tells you the most about the thing being referenced. Here, lipu is the head, so this is some kind of paper or document. Then musi modifies lipu, making it more specific. Now check the spoiler!

You can modify words in the subject, predicate, and object:

<details><summary> jan pona li toki</summary>

The nurse is giving instructions!

---

- A good person is talking.
- A friend is talking.
- The benefactor is speaking.
- A philanthropist is giving a speech.
- Good people are having a conversation.

</details>

Here, the _subject_ is modified: this is a `jan`, and the `jan` is `pona`! It's similar to saying `jan li pona`, but in a single phrase.

<details><summary> mi sona pona e lipu </summary>

I thoroughly understand the paper.

---

- I understand the paper well.
- I deeply understand the book.

</details>

Here, the predicate is modified: `sona` is the start of the predicate, and `pona` changes it. Here, `pona` is making `sona` more intense. You could also use `wawa` to intensify `sona`- the feeling is different though!

<!-- This sentence has a similar meaning: -->

<!-- > mi sona wawa e lipu -->

<!-- As an exercise, think about why that is! -->

<details><summary> sina lukin e kasi suwi </summary>

You're looking at a cute flower!

You're seeing a sweet plant.

---

</details>

Here, the object `kasi` is modified with `suwi`. Try splitting this into two sentences:

> mi lukin e kasi. kasi li suwi.

This provides mostly the same meaning: First, you look at the plant. Second, you observe that the plant is cute.

::: info

mi and sina can be modified, even in the **subject**. If you do, you still use li! You only omit li if the subject is _exactly_ mi or _exactly_ sina. [Check the first lesson again](./mi-sina.html)!

:::

<details><summary> kulupu mi li pakala wawa e kiwen suli </summary>

My team _crushed_ a huge boulder.

My community _blew up_ an enormous slate!

---

Also, the `kiwen` is now a `kiwen pakala`!

</details>

You can even modify multiple phrases at once!

- `kulupu` modified by `mi` means the group is related to or owned by the speaker.
- `pakala` modified by `wawa` makes this destruction _powerful_ or _intense!_
- `kiwen` modified by `suli` makes the rock huge or important!
- Lastly, `kulupu` applies `pakala` to the `kiwen`, giving the `kiwen` a new property.

Check your understanding under the spoiler!

::: info

If you get lost reading a sentence, try ignoring the modifiers and reading just the heads, the first word of each phrase!

:::

#### Many Modifiers

You can modify a head with many words! Same as for one modifier, it doesn't matter what part of speech it goes in.

<details><summary> mi sona e wawa nasa lete </summary>

I know a magical ice power!

---

- I'm aware of a weird freezing power.
- I understand a rare power of frost.
- I am well-studied on novel cooling abilities

</details>

Importantly, the order _does not matter_. `wawa nasa lete` and `wawa lete nasa` are the same thing.
Think it through: In English, `wawa nasa lete` is a weird cold power. `wawa lete nasa` is a cold weird power.
These statements aren't even different in English!

<details><summary> jan li kalama musi suwi! </summary>

Somebody is singing sweetly.

---

- A person makes a cute, fun sound.
- A boy is humming softly.

</details>

Same as before, the order does not matter. `kalama musi suwi` and `kalama suwi musi` are the same.

#### pi phrases

`pi` introduces a new head, and that head plus all the words that follow it become a single modifier. Then that modifier applies to the head of the entire phrase. That's a complex idea, so let's explore it!

<details><summary> mi jan pi pali kasi. </summary>

I'm a gardener.

---

- I'm somebody who works with plants!
- I'm a farmer.

</details>

Here, the predicate begins with `jan`. `pi` turns the following words into a single modifier, with the first word as a head: `pali` modified by `kasi` makes it plant-related work. Apply this idea to `jan` and you're done. Check the spoiler!

::: info

You **must** have two words or more after pi! You can't use pi for one word because that word is already the modifier you want.

:::

<details><summary> mi jan suli pi sona kasi. </summary>

I'm an expert botanist.

---

- I'm a researcher who knows a lot about plants.
- I'm an important person in plant knowledge.

</details>

You can have a `pi` phrase after other modifiers. The same rules apply: `pi` turns everything that follows it into a modifier, and that applies to the head of the whole phrase. Here, `jan` is _both_ `suli` and `sona kasi`. Check your understanding!

::: warning

For clarity, limit yourself to **one pi** per phrase.

Some speakers say that multiple pi modify _the one before_, while others say each modifies _the whole phrase's head_. Don't even bother!

:::

#### ala

`ala` has a simple function, but unique behaviors. It functions exactly how you expect as a head, but let's take a closer look at `ala` as a modifier.

<details><summary> mi pona ala. </summary>

I'm not well.

---

- I'm not good.

</details>

Here, `pona` is negated by `ala`- it's like saying "not".

::: warning

Toki Pona words don't have true opposites. There are some meanings of **pona** that are opposite of **ike**, but **pona ala** is _not_ ike.

:::

Compare the phrases "this is good" and "this is not bad" in English. They are close together in meaning, but the negation does not make them the same.

<details><summary> jan ala li ante e toki. </summary>

No person changed the discussion.

</details>

Words in any part of speech may be negated. Negating the subject can be similar to negating the predicate- consider this restatement:

> jan li ante ala e toki.

The meaning is the same _in this case_, although there is room for question. For example, does the first case imply that something besides `jan` _did_ make the `toki` become `ante`?

::: info

Since you can use ala to negate any head noun or modifier, you can use it in pi phrases too!

:::

`ala` doesn't have to negate a whole phrase. It can negate only one modifier, the one right before it. This can't always be told apart from negating the entire phrase:

> sina ante ike ala.

This statement could be "you're not badly-different " or "you're not-badly different". Most speakers will restate when they intend the second:

> sina ante pi ike ala

With the pi phrase, this statement is clearly "You're not-badly different." That's not a bad compliment!

#### taso

Sometimes you'll see `taso` at the start of a sentence. This is like saying "but" or "however," and is usually used before a _later_ sentence to connect two ideas.

<details><summary> mi kute e pakala. taso mi pona. </summary>

I heard something break. But I'm alright!

</details>

The first sentence establishes some context, and the second provides some clarifying or contrary information.

For comparison, here is the second sentence without `taso`.

> mi kute e pakala. mi pona.

The second sentence still provides clarifying info, but it now appears separate from the first sentence.

::: info

The subject rarely starts with taso, so you can easily tell subject taso from but/however taso.
If taso is the subject and modified, it could be hard to tell what the speaker means!

## Exercises

### Toki Pona to English

One of your friends has been confiding in you that they have no idea what to get for their partner's birthday. You quietly talk to some others, and bring back suggestions for gifts and surprises. Finally, you tell everyone the plan your friend went with:

<details><summary> ona li pana e kasi laso loje </summary>

They gifted red and blue flowers.

---

- He gave a red and green tree!

::: info

Remember, modifier order doesn't matter. Both the modifiers affect the head noun _separately_ and _no matter their order_, so this kasi is separately laso _and_ loje- they don't mix!

:::

</details>

It's pollen season, and every surface in sight is coated in a fine yellow dust. When you step outside, you start sneezing up a storm. One of your friends, fortunate to not be affected, asks what's wrong. You explain:

<details><summary> ko jelo kasi li ike e mi </summary>

Pollen gives me allergies.

---

- Plant-related yellow dust hurts me.
- Yellow flower dust makes me feel bad.
- Yellow tree mush causes me to feel icky.

</details>

You're watching a friend confidently dive through piles of trash to find their lost hat. You're grossed out, but they insist they'll find it. Eventually, they come up from the pile with their hat! But the hat desperately needs to be washed after its garbage stint. Your friend tries to hand you the hat, and you exclaim:

<details><summary> ni li jaki. mi pilin ala e ni! </summary>

This is gross. I'm not touching it!

::: info

Since the two pieces of information are not contrary or clarifying here, you wouldn't use taso!

:::

</details>

Your penpal said in their last letter that they sent a gift! You had no idea what was coming, but you were so excited for it. When the gift finally came, you open it up to find a personalized piece of art, and you rush to write back that it arrived in good condition:

<details><summary> mi jo pona e pana sina! </summary>

I safely received your gift!

</details>

You're discussing hobbies with a friend, especially when you like to work on your hobbies. Your friend is a morning person and loves feeling the sun as they're productive. You like the sun, but prefer to work in the dark when the moon is out. You tell them:

<details><summary> suno li pona. taso pimeja li pona e pali mi. </summary>

The sun is good, but darkness helps me work.

---

- Sunlight is okay, but the shade improves my productivity.
- Lights are wonderful, but I prefer no lights for my hobbies.

</details>

A teacher is struggling to calm their students. The teacher comes in with a new plan each class, but the class stays rowdy! Finally, the teacher turns learning into a group activity, where each student learns one thing and then teaches it to their partner. When asked how the activity went later, the teacher responds excitedly:

<details><summary> pilin mi li ni: ona li kute sona e mi! </summary>

My thought is that they heard and understood me!

---

- My impression is this: they understood what I said!
- I think that they listened to me.
- I feel that they followed by instructions.

</details>

As the air gets cooler and the sun is out for less time each day, you begin to notice the leaves on the trees change color. In your excitement for the changing seasons, you tell everyone you know:

<details><summary> kule kasi li ante </summary>

The plants are changing color!

The color of plants is changing!

---

- The plant-color is different.

</details>

It's the middle of winter, and you've seen nothing but dreary gray skies for weeks. One day, the cloud cover finally breaks, opening up to reveal beautiful sunlight! You step outside to bask, but unfortunately, the air is still frigid around you. You remark to yourself:

<details><summary> mi pilin e suno. taso mi lete. </summary>

I feel the sunlight, but I feel cold.

---

</details>

Your friend has become quite philosophical as of late, and has been throwing various statements in their new philosophical views your way for review. The most recent one seems rather obvious to you, but you don't let them know that. The statement:

<details><summary> ala li pona taso. </summary>

Nothing is exclusively good.

Nothingness is only good!

::: info

This statement has two possible interpretations, even in the given context! It could be saying that _no object exists which is entirely good_, or _nothingness itself is exclusively good_.

:::

</details>

Your friend is down-trodden, feeling rejected. They haven't been invited to any parties or events lately, and are worried that all their friends are abandoning them. As a way of lashing out, they insist their friends are the problem, but you console them with some helpful perspective:

<details><summary> jan pona sina li ike ala! ona li pali taso. ona li wile e sina </summary>

Your friends are not mean! They're only working. They want you.

---

- Your teachers aren't bad. They're just busy. They need you!

## Takeaway

#### Terminology

We can change words in every part of speech with **Modifiers**, making them more specific.

The word at the start of the phrase is called the **Head**, after its "head" position in a phrase. It can also be called the **Head Noun**.

We also have a few new **particles**. There's some nuance to what that means, now that some of the particles do more than grammatical work, but that can be left for study outside these lessons!

#### Grammar

Toki Pona sentences still look the same:

> [subject] (li) [predicate] (e [object])

But now, each phrase can be modified! This does not change where each belongs, but it lets you be more specific about what you say.

Also, you can optionally include `taso` before a sentence, which connects it to previous statements in a similar way to "but" or "however" in English.

> (taso) [subject] (li) [predicate] (e [object])

#### Ambiguity

A few times during this lesson, we noticed that some phrases are **ambiguous**. There are multiple possible interpretations, open-ended statements that need more detail, and more. This is a common feature of Toki Pona. You do not need to specifically learn to avoid it- that will come naturally as you figure out what works and what doesn't!

That said, if any ambiguity or even simple misunderstanding comes up when speaking, restating yourself is helpful!

#### Modifiers and the Head

Modifiers _other than `ala`_ do not change what they modify, only make it more specific. `sona lipu` is a kind of `sona`. `suli wawa` is a kind of `suli`. You can observe this in English too: a blue book is still a kind of book, and a thorough understanding is still a kind of understanding. Toki Pona always works like this, and you can

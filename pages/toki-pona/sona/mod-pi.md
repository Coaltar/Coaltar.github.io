## Overview

#### One Modifier

In Toki Pona, words may be _modified_ by adding words after the first in a phrase. This first word is called the **Head**, or sometimes **Head Noun**. Every word after the head is a **Modifier**. Here's an example phrase:

<details><summary class=tokipona>lipu musi.</summary>

- Joke book
- Fun paper
- Entertaining document

</details>

The first word is the most important, telling you the most about the thing. Here, `lipu` is the head, so this is some kind of paper or document. Then `musi` modifies `lipu`, making it more specific. Now check the spoiler!

<details><summary class=tokipona> jan pona li toki.</summary>

The nurse is giving instructions!

---

- A good person is talking.
- A friend is talking.
- The benefactor is speaking.
- A philanthropist is giving a speech.
- Good people are having a conversation.

</details>

Here, the _subject_ is modified: this is a `jan`, and the `jan` is `pona`! It's similar to saying `jan li pona`, but in a single phrase.

<details><summary class=tokipona> mi sona suli e lipu. </summary>

I critically understand the paper.

---

- I understand the document in an important way.
- I deeply understand the book.

</details>

Here, the predicate is modified: `sona` is the start of the predicate, and `suli` changes it. `suli` is making `sona` more important.

<details><summary class=tokipona> sina lukin e kasi suwi. </summary>

You're looking at a cute flower!

---

- You're seeing a sweet plant.
- You're observing an adorable forest.
- Y'all are perceiving a soft vine.

</details>

Here, the object `kasi` is modified with `suwi`. Try splitting this into two sentences:

> sina lukin e kasi. kasi li suwi.

This means mostly the same: You look at the plant. The plant is cute.

::: info

mi and sina can be modified, even in the **subject**. If you do, you still use li! You only omit li if the subject is _exactly_ mi or _exactly_ sina. [Check the first lesson again](./mi-sina.html)!

:::

<details><summary class=tokipona> kulupu mi li pakala wawa e kiwen suli! </summary>

My team _crushed_ a huge boulder.

My community _blew up_ an enormous slate!

---

Also, the `kiwen` is now a `kiwen pakala`!

</details>

You can even modify multiple phrases at once!

- `kulupu mi` means the group is related to or owned by the speaker.
- `pakala wawa` makes this destruction _powerful_ or _intense!_
- `kiwen suli` makes the rock huge or important!
- Lastly, `kulupu` applies `pakala` to the `kiwen`, giving the `kiwen` a new property.

Check your understanding under the spoiler!

::: info

If you get lost reading a sentence, try ignoring the modifiers and reading just the heads, the first word of each phrase!

:::

#### Many Modifiers

You can modify a head with many words!

<details><summary class=tokipona> mi sona e wawa nasa lete! </summary>

I know a magical ice power!

---

- I'm aware of a weird freezing power.
- I understand a rare power of frost.
- I am well-studied on novel cooling abilities

</details>

Importantly, the order _does not matter_. `wawa nasa lete` and `wawa lete nasa` are the same thing.
Think it through: In English, `wawa nasa lete` is a weird cold power. `wawa lete nasa` is a cold weird power.
These statements aren't even different in English!

<details><summary class=tokipona> jan li kalama musi suwi! </summary>

Somebody is singing sweetly.

---

- A person makes a cute, fun sound.
- A boy is humming softly.

</details>

Same as before, the order does not matter. `kalama musi suwi` and `kalama suwi musi` are the same.

#### pi phrases

`pi` introduces a new head, and that head plus all the words that follow it become a single modifier. Then that modifier applies to the head of the entire phrase. That's a complex idea, so let's explore it!

<details><summary class=tokipona> mi jan pi pali kasi. </summary>

I'm a gardener.

---

- I'm somebody who works with plants!
- I'm a farmer.

</details>

Here, the predicate begins with `jan`. `pi` turns the following words into a single modifier, with the first word as a head: `pali` modified by `kasi` makes it plant-related work. Apply this idea to `jan` and you're done. Check the spoiler!

::: info

You **must** have two words or more after pi! You can't use pi for one word because that word is already the modifier you want.

:::

<details><summary class=tokipona> mi jan suli pi sona kasi. </summary>

I'm an expert botanist.

---

- I'm a researcher who knows a lot about plants.
- I'm an important person in plant knowledge.

</details>

You can have a `pi` phrase after other modifiers. The same rules apply: `pi` turns everything that follows it into a modifier, and that applies to the head of the whole phrase. Here, `jan` is _both_ `suli` and `sona kasi`. Check your understanding!

::: warning

For clarity, limit yourself to **one pi** per phrase.

Some speakers say that multiple pi modify _the one before_, while others say each modifies _the whole phrase's head_. Don't even bother!

## Exercises

### Toki Pona to English

#### One Modifier

Your penpal said in their last letter that they sent a gift! You had no idea what was coming, but you were so excited for it. When the gift finally came, you open it up to find a personalized piece of art, and you rush to write back that it arrived in good condition:

<details><summary class=tokipona> mi jo pona e pana sina! </summary>

I safely have your gift!

</details>

A teacher is struggling to calm their students. The teacher comes in with a new plan each class, but the class stays rowdy! Finally, the teacher turns learning into a group activity, where each student learns one thing and then teaches it to their partner. When asked how the activity went later, the teacher responds excitedly:

<details><summary class=tokipona> pilin mi li ni: ona li kute sona e mi! </summary>

My thought is that they heard and understood me!

---

- My impression is this: they understood what I said!
- I think that they listened to me.
- I feel that they followed by instructions.

</details>

As the air gets cooler and the sun is out for less time each day, you begin to notice the leaves on the trees change color. In your excitement for the changing seasons, you tell everyone you know:

<details><summary class=tokipona> **kule kasi li ante!** </summary>

The plants are changing color!

The color of plants is changing!

---

- The plant-color is different.

::: info

`kule` can be used to refer to more colors than Toki Pona normally has! Think of saying "The color of sand" in English; this would be `kule ko` in Toki Pona.

:::

</details>

#### Many Modifiers

It's pollen season, and every surface in sight is coated in a fine yellow dust. When you step outside, you start sneezing up a storm. One of your friends, fortunate to not be affected, asks what's wrong. You explain:

<details><summary class=tokipona> ko jelo kasi li ike e mi </summary>

Pollen gives me allergies.

---

- Plant-related yellow dust hurts me.
- Yellow flower dust makes me feel bad.
- Yellow tree mush causes me to feel icky.

</details>

You've been excitedly telling your friend about a fantastic ice cream shop that opened only a few weeks ago- they have the best ice cream in the city! You finally convince your friend to go with you, they get a bowl of ice cream heaped tall, and they realize how much they've been missing by not going sooner! They tell you:

<details><summary class=tokipona> lete walo ni ale li suwi mute!  </summary>

All this vanilla ice cream is sweet and delicious!

---

- All this white ice is super sweet!
- A

</details>

One of your friends has been confiding in you that they have no idea what to get for their partner's birthday. You quietly talk to some others, and bring back suggestions for gifts and surprises. Finally, you tell everyone the plan your friend went with:

<details><summary class=tokipona> **ona li pana e kasi laso loje.** </summary>

They gifted red and blue flowers.

::: info

Remember, modifier order doesn't matter. Both the modifiers affect the head _separately_ and _no matter their order_, so kasi is laso _and_ loje- they don't mix!

:::

</details>

#### pi phrases

You're having a conversation on the phone with a long distance friend who speaks Toki Pona! You're walking in public while doing so, keeping your volume down to be respectful. But a little kid comes running up and, in the blunt way only a child can, says you talk super weirdly! When you get back to your call, you explain:

<details><summary class=tokipona> jan lili li toki e ni: mi toki pi nasa mute! </summary>

A small child said this: I speak weirdly!

</details>

As you've been reading through a series of Toki Pona lessons, you slowly but surely gain an understanding and appreciation of Toki Pona. You've been talking to your friends through the process, trying to convince them to join in, and you say to demonstrate:

<details><summary class=tokipona> sona mi pi toki pona li suli! </summary>

My understanding of Toki Pona is huge!

---

- My knowledge of the good language is big!
- My comprehension of the simple language is enormous!

</details>

You've been writing down your thoughts and feelings in a journal as a meditation exercise. Unfortunately, you lost it somewhere, so you call up your friends and explain what you lost, what is important about it, and what it looks like:

<details><summary class=tokipona> **lipu pi loje jelo li jo e sona mi.** </summary>

The orange journal has my knowledge.

The orange journal has my writings.

::: info

Here, `loje` is a head noun, and `jelo` modifies it. Unlike before, we're changing a color from one shade to another with a modifier, instead of having two separate shades both present!

:::

</details>

### English to Toki Pona

<details><summary> I want the shiny white rock! </summary>

mi wile e kiwen walo suno!

mi wile e kiwen walo pona!

</details>

<details><summary> **All of these are strange-feeling.** </summary>

ni ale li nasa pilin!

::: warning

The strange-feeling part is tricky! `nasa` is a more appropriate head noun than `pilin`, because "these" are being "strange" in some way: a `pilin` way.

:::

</details>

<details><summary> This is a fantastic shade of blue </summary>

kule laso ni li pona mute!

kule laso ni li pona!

kule telo ni li pona!

</details>

<details><summary> The sun is very bright. </summary>

suno li wawa mute.

</details>

<details><summary> They are making a guide to explosions! </summary>

ona li pali e lipu pi sona pakala!

ona li pali e lipu pakala!

::: info

pakala can directly modify lipu and _not_ mean that the lipu is broken! It can be related to broken-ness as well.

:::

</details>

## Takeaway

#### Terminology

We can change words in every part of speech with **Modifiers**, making them more specific.

The word at the start of the phrase is called the **Head**, after its "head" position in a phrase. It can also be called the **Head Noun**.

We also have a new **particle**. There's some nuance to what that means, now that some of the particles do more than grammatical work, but that can be left for study outside these lessons!

#### Grammar

Toki Pona sentences still look the same:

> [subject] (li) [predicate] (e [object])

But now, each phrase can be modified! This does not change where anything belongs, but it lets you be more specific about what you say.

#### Modifiers and Meaning

Modifiers do not _change_ what they modify, only make it more specific.

- `sona lipu` is a `sona`.
- `suli wawa` is a `suli`.
- `kiwen pakala` is a `kiwen`
- `jan ante` is a `jan`!

You can see this in English too: a blue book is a kind of book, and a deep understanding is still a kind of understanding. Toki Pona always works like this, with _one_ exception coming up next lesson.

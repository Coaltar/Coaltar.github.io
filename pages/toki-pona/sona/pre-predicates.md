One word here is a particle _and_ content word! You'll be able to tell these apart by how the word is used.

## Overview

#### Pre-predicates

**Pre-predicates**, also known as **pre-verbs** or **pre-preds**, are a set of words that can be placed at the start of the predicate to alter its meaning.

We already know some of them: `wile`, `sona`, and `lukin` are back!

There are exactly seven pre-predicates in common use, so we'll cover them all.

<details><summary> mi wile pali </summary>

I want to create.

---

</details>

The `wile` pre-predicate means the predicate is wanted, generally implying it isn't something you have already.

You could say:

> mi wile e pali

And it _could_ mean the same thing. But it's more clear to say `mi wile pali` because something in the object position will often be considered some specific physical thing, or an idea. What if it were intended to be an action? Then a pre-predicate is more clear!

<details><summary> mi ken wawa </summary>

I am able to be strong.

</details>

::: error

You can't always tell apart a normal predicate from a pre-predicate. Context can help!

:::

<details><summary> sina kama sona! </summary>

You are learning!

</details>

<details><summary> </summary>

::: info

You can think of pre-predicates as a special kind of **modifier**!

:::

</details>

<details><summary> </summary>

</details>

::: info

You can even use a pre-predicate as a predicate at the same time, such as saying **mi wile wile**!

:::

<details><summary> mi lukin sona e sina </summary>

</details>
<details><summary> mi alasa sona e sina </summary>

I'm trying to understand you.

</details>

Lastly, there's `lukin` and `alasa`, which have the same meaning as preverbs: to try.

::: info

:::

#### Multiple pre-predicates

Like modifiers, you can use multiple pre-predicates at the same time! They function exactly how you expect:

<details><summary> mi awen ken sona ni: mi mama e kasi  </summary>

I am still able to skillfully do this: I raise plants.

I am still able to skillfully do this: I mother plants.

</details>

- `awen` means something is ongoing
- `ken` means something is a capability
- `sona` means something is done skillfully or knowledgeably
- The predicate `ni` is referencing the next sentence!

#### ala

`ala` has a simple function: negate the previous word or phrase.

<details><summary> mi pona ala. </summary>

I'm not well.

---

- I'm not good.

</details>

Here, `pona` is negated by `ala`- it's like saying "not".

::: warning

Toki Pona words don't have true opposites. There are some meanings of **pona** that are opposite of **ike**, but **pona ala** is _not_ ike.

:::

Compare the phrases "this is good" and "this is not bad" in English. They are close together in meaning, but the negation does not make them the same.

<details><summary> jan ala li ante e toki. </summary>

No person changed the discussion.

</details>

Words in any part of speech may be negated. Negating the subject can be similar to negating the predicate- consider this restatement:

> jan li ante ala e toki.

The meaning is the same _in this case_, although there is room for question. For example, does the first case imply that something besides `jan` _did_ make the `toki` become `ante`?

::: info

Since you can use ala to negate any head noun or modifier, you can use it in pi phrases too!

:::

`ala` doesn't have to negate a whole phrase. It can negate only one modifier, the one right before it. This can't always be told apart from negating the entire phrase:

> sina ante ike ala.

This statement could be "you're not badly-different " or "you're not-badly different". Most speakers will restate when they intend the second:

> sina ante pi ike ala

With the pi phrase, this statement is clearly "You're not-badly different." That's not a bad compliment!

kiwen lete ni li walo ala

lete ni li walo ala

</details>

<details><summary> I didn't do that! </summary>

mi ni ala!

</details>

## Takeaway

#### Clarity of Grammar

If something is in the **predicate**, it will often be assumed to be an **action**. This is especially true when an **object** is present with `e`.

If something is in the **object**, it will often be assumed to be a **thing**, especially something physical.

Neither of these are true _all_ the time, but they are true often enough that you can take advantage of it! If you want to reference an action, putting that in the predicate can be helpful, and the same goes for putting physical things in the object.

Pre-verbs.

#### Ambiguity

A few times during this lesson, we noticed that some phrases are **ambiguous**. There are multiple possible interpretations, open-ended statements that need more detail, and more. This is a common feature of Toki Pona. You do not need to specifically learn to avoid it- that will come naturally as you figure out what works and what doesn't!

That said, if any ambiguity or even simple misunderstanding comes up when speaking, restating yourself is helpful!

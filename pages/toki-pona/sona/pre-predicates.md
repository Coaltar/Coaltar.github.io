One word here is a particle _and_ content word! You'll be able to tell these apart by how the word is used.

## Overview

#### ala

`ala` has a simple function, but unique behaviors. It functions exactly how you expect as a head, but let's take a closer look at `ala` as a modifier.

<details><summary> mi pona ala. </summary>

I'm not well.

---

- I'm not good.

</details>

Here, `pona` is negated by `ala`- it's like saying "not".

::: warning

Toki Pona words don't have true opposites. There are some meanings of **pona** that are opposite of **ike**, but **pona ala** is _not_ ike.

:::

Compare the phrases "this is good" and "this is not bad" in English. They are close together in meaning, but the negation does not make them the same.

<details><summary> jan ala li ante e toki. </summary>

No person changed the discussion.

</details>

Words in any part of speech may be negated. Negating the subject can be similar to negating the predicate- consider this restatement:

> jan li ante ala e toki.

The meaning is the same _in this case_, although there is room for question. For example, does the first case imply that something besides `jan` _did_ make the `toki` become `ante`?

::: info

Since you can use ala to negate any head noun or modifier, you can use it in pi phrases too!

:::

`ala` doesn't have to negate a whole phrase. It can negate only one modifier, the one right before it. This can't always be told apart from negating the entire phrase:

> sina ante ike ala.

This statement could be "you're not badly-different " or "you're not-badly different". Most speakers will restate when they intend the second:

> sina ante pi ike ala

With the pi phrase, this statement is clearly "You're not-badly different." That's not a bad compliment!

## Exercises

I introduced new words for this lesson, so here are some examples that don't use these new words as preverbs. That way you can get a feel for them!

#### Not Preverbs

#### Preverbs

#### More examples with `ala`

#### One more note on `taso`

## Takeaway

#### Ambiguity

A few times during this lesson, we noticed that some phrases are **ambiguous**. There are multiple possible interpretations, open-ended statements that need more detail, and more. This is a common feature of Toki Pona. You do not need to specifically learn to avoid it- that will come naturally as you figure out what works and what doesn't!

That said, if any ambiguity or even simple misunderstanding comes up when speaking, restating yourself is helpful!

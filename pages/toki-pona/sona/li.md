### Words to Know

All new words will be separated into categories!

#### Particles

Particles are for grammar. They are used for sentence structure, introducing new parts of a sentence. Most do not have meanings, only functions.

::: tpdefinitions

| Glyph | Word | Use                                          |
| ----- | ---- | -------------------------------------------- |
| li    | li   | (mark a predicate; begin a predicate phrase) |

:::

#### Content Words

Content words have meaning, and can be in both the subject and predicate, plus others we'll see later!

::: tpdefinitions

| Glyph  | Word   | Definition                                    |
| ------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------- |

| kiwen  | kiwen  | rock, hard, tough, sturdy, durable            |
| ko     | ko     | dust, goop, clay, paste, squishy thing        |

The words from the last lesson were content words too!

## Overview

#### li and Predicates

The next type of Toki Pona sentence is a simple but powerful addition!

> [subject] li [predicate]

With this sentence, you can talk about things other than yourself and your listener. While `li` is present, any word but `mi` and `sina` can be in the subject, and any word can be in the predicate like in last lesson. You'll find that the variety in Toki Pona words lets you say a lot, even with so few words!

<details> <summary> A note on "any word" </summary>

I do say "any word", but clever observers will have noticed I am treating the word `li` differently. It is introduced as a particle, its definition is given in parentheses, and it is treated as a grammatical structure instead of as a word. This is because `li` cannot be used in the subject or predicate, with some subtle exceptions we'll get to later. For now, everything _else_ can be in the subject or predicate.

</details>

Since using `li` lets you put any word in the subject, most of the words in the lesson before can now be used there! This leans heavily into the action/description duality described before. Unlike that duality, you can tell which sense a word is meant in based on its place in a sentence. Words in the subject are more likely to be specific objects or ideas, where words in the predicate are more likely to be actions or descriptions!

::: warning

Remember, if the subject is _just_ mi or _just_ sina, do not include li!

:::

Here's a few guided examples:

<details> <summary class=tokipona> mama li musi </summary>

- Mom is hilarious.
- Dad is being funny.
- My parent is exciting!
- My babysitter is amusing!
- Grandpa is joking.

</details>

Here, the subject is `mama`, a parent or ancestor. Since the subject isn't `mi` or `sina`, `li` is present and starts the predicate. Then the predicate is `musi`, fun and entertainment.
`musi` could be either a description or action here, and these cannot be told apart without more context. Check under the spoiler for possible interpretations!

## Exercises

### Toki Pona to English

You and a friend are looking through old photos. Your friend points to one of a person leaning against a wall, smiling wide at the camera and says:

On an epic quest, you stop at a wizard's tower and climb it. At the top, the wizard is deep in research. He teaches you a new spell to aid your journey: Spoonform. With this power, you can turn into a spoon for a short time. You don't tell the wizard, but you think to yourself:

<details> <summary class=tokipona> wawa li nasa </summary>

Magic is ridiculous!

## Takeaway

#### Grammar

In the previous lesson, we covered a sentence which exclusively began with either `mi` or `sina`. In this lesson, we covered a sentence where anything can start the sentence- so long as it is followed by `li`. In fact, these are the same kind of sentence!

> [mi/sina] [predicate]

> [subject] li [predicate]

Another way to think about this sentence is this: if the subject is _exactly_ mi or _exactly_ sina, don't include `li`.

#### Content Words and Particles

Any _meaningful_ word may appear in either the subject, the predicate, or both at once. When I say "meaningful", this refers the idea of a **content word**, or a word which serves some _semantic_ function instead of an exclusively grammatical one. The word `li` is only grammatical- it is not a content word. Every other word so far is a content word.

The word `li` is a **particle**, and is not the only one! We will learn about the rest in future lessons. What they have in common is having no semantic function- no meaning.

There are also a handful of words which are so-called **pseudo-particles**. This category is more blurry, but it contains words which have functions as particles _and_ as content words.

## Overview

> [subject] li [predicate]

With this sentence, you can talk about things other than yourself and your listener. Any word but `mi` and `sina` can be in the subject, and any word can be in the predicate! Anything is possible! We're still limited to either basic action or description, but you'll find that the variety in Toki Pona words lets you say a lot.

## Takeaway

#### Grammar

The sentence type in this lesson is exactly the same as the mi/sina sentences from the lesson before, but the subject can be different.
Another way to think about it is that both `[mi/sina] [predicate]` and `[subject] li [predicate]` are the same kind of sentence-
but if the subject is _exactly_ mi or sina, you don't include `li`.

#### Content Words and the Subject/Predicate

As in many of the examples, any _meaningful_ word may appear in either the subject _or_ the predicate, or even both at once.

When I say "meaningful", this means the idea of a content word, or a word with a specific definition.

## Overview

The most basic Toki Pona sentence has two parts: a subject and a predicate.

> [subject] [predicate]

For this kind of sentence, two subjects are possible:

- `mi` - First person pronoun. I, me, my, mine, we, our, myself, ourselves
- `sina` - Second person pronoun. You, yours, yourself, y'all, y'all's

This means English interpretations looks something like this:

> I am [predicate]

> We are [predicate]

> You are [predicate]

> Y'all are [predicate]

The predicate is always able to be a verb, adjective, or both. Any
verb/adjective may be used to describe the speaker/listener, and their actions.

## Takeaway

There are many given definitions and sentence interpretations. This is
intended! And it comes from two different effects:

#### Verb/Adjective duality

As noted before, predicates in Toki Pona words may be verbs, adjectives, or
both! If something is an action, it is also a description. In English, you
might say that if a person walks, they are also a walking person. Toki Pona
runs with this idea. There is no difference between "doing" and "being"
expressed by the words or grammar.

#### Broadness

Toki Pona words have broad meanings. "mi" doesn't refer to just yourself like
"I" does. It can also refer to a group of people including yourself like "we",
an action taken on yourself like "myself", and something that belongs to you
such as "mine" or "my"; all of these depend on context and place in a sentence.
"sina" works the same way, and so do _all_ Toki Pona words.

Words do not mark plurality or tense either! "jan" may talk about one person,
four people, an entire population of people, and anything between. "moku" may
talk about eating right now, eating in the near future, drinking in the distant
past, becoming edible exactly a week from now, and more.

This is a lot, but the broadness is part of the strength of Toki Pona. And, it
is easier to navigate than you think! Context is everything, and understanding
a sentence is much easier when you're seeing what it describes.

That said, a helpful strategy for understanding a sentence with less context is
to consider how reasonable it is. For example, "mi moku" is able to mean "we
are food", but it is more likely that "mi" is just the speaker, and "moku" is
"eat". You can use this thinking to reason about sentences in the future.

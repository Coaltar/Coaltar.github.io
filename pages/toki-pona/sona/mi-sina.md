## Overview

The most basic Toki Pona sentence has two parts: a subject and a predicate.

> [subject] [predicate]

For this kind of sentence, two subjects are possible:

- `mi` - First person pronoun. I, me, my, mine, we, our, myself, ourselves
- `sina` - Second person pronoun. You, yours, yourself, y'all, y'all's

This means English interpretations looks something like this:

> I am [predicate]

> We are [predicate]

> You are [predicate]

> Y'all are [predicate]

The predicate is always able to be a verb, adjective, or both. Any
verb/adjective may be used to describe the speaker/listener, and their actions.

## Takeaway

There are many given definitions and sentence interpretations. This is
intended! And it comes from two different effects:

#### Verb/Adjective duality

As noted before, predicates in Toki Pona words may be verbs, adjectives, or
both! If something is an action, it is also a description. In English, you
might say that if a person walks, they are also a walking person. Toki Pona
runs with this idea. There is no difference between "doing" and "being"
expressed by the words or grammar.

<details> <summary> A note on "verb" and "adjective" </summary>

Though I do use "verb" and "adjective" to describe the properties of the sentence, they are not a great fit for what Toki Pona's words do. In the community, _predicate_ is preferred over verb, and _adjective_ is rarely used in analyzing the predicate.

</details>

#### Broadness

Toki Pona words have broad meanings. `mi` doesn't refer to just yourself like
"I" does. It can also refer to a group of people including yourself like "we",
an action taken on yourself like "myself", and something that belongs to you
such as "mine" or "my"; all of these depend on context and place in a sentence.
`sina` works the same way, and so do _all_ Toki Pona words.

Words do not mark plurality or tense either! `jan` may talk about one person,
four people, an entire population of people, and anything between. `moku` may
talk about eating right now, eating in the near future, drinking in the distant
past, becoming edible exactly a week from now, and more.

This is a lot, but the broadness is part of the strength of Toki Pona. And, it
is easier to navigate than you think! Context is everything, and understanding
a sentence is much easier when you're seeing what it describes.

That said, a helpful strategy for understanding a sentence with less context is
to consider how reasonable it is. For example, `mi moku` is able to mean "we
are food", but it is more likely that `mi` is just the speaker, and `moku` is
"eat". You can use this thinking to reason about sentences in the future.

## Other Notes

As in one of the examples, which is _not_ a sentence, you can say `toki` on its own to mean "hello!"

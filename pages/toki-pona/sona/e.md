## Overview

#### e and Objects

This new sentence is capable of changing things in the world. The subject can now act on other things, applying the predicate to something else, with the use of `e`!

> [mi/sina] [predicate] e [object]

> [subject] li [predicate] e [object]

This new phrase introduces a thing the subject acts on in a way that the predicate specifies.

<details><summary>A note about "predicate"</summary>

I am using "predicate" to refer to _just_ the position of the action/description of a phrase, excluding the object.

In common grammatical terms, "predicate" refers to the entirety of the action/description and the object(s) it acts on. However, it can also refer to just the action/description clause, which is very convenient for these lessons!

</details>

#### Changing things

Here are a few guided examples of how the subject acts on the object, applying the predicate to it:

<details> <summary class=tokipona> mi pona e jan. </summary>

- I help somebody.
- I improve people.
- I heal people.
- I tend to people.
- I make people feel better.

</details>

The `jan` becomes `pona` in some way, as in the translations given.

<details> <summary class=tokipona> lape li wawa e sina. </summary>

- Sleep makes you stronger
- Rest makes you confident
- Napping makes you energetic
- Relaxing energizes you
- Vacation empowers you

</details>

Here, `sina` becomes `wawa` in some way.

#### Not changing things

Not everything changes the object! Here are some examples, using two new words:

<details> <summary class=tokipona> jan li pilin e kiwen. </summary>

- The person feels a rock.
- Somebody touched metal.
- Everyone touched this stone.
- People have been feeling this rock.

</details>

Here, the `kiwen` is _felt_ or _touched_, but it never is or becomes `pilin`.
Instead, the subject is the only one that does any `pilin`.

<details> <summary class=tokipona> mi wile e telo. </summary>

- I want water
- I need water
- I need (liquid) fuel
- I am thirsty

</details>

Again, the `telo` is _wanted_ or _needed_, but it does not become `wile` or do the action `wile` or become describable by `wile`. The subject _wants_, _needs_, `wile` the `telo`.

As you study, you'll get an intuitive sense for this difference.
Some words will be actions the subject takes on an object, but which do not change that object.
Other words will change the object in some way, usually applying a new property to the object.

<details> <summary> A note on "not" changing things </summary>

As you become more advanced in Toki Pona, you'll learn that the above is somewhat disingenuous. It _is_ possible to describe an object as a wanted object, and to apply want to that object. For the time being, this simplification will work.

That said, the following is possible:

> mi wile e telo.

"I want water."

> telo wile li pona e mi.

"The water I want will make me feel better."

This uses a modifier (next lesson!) to demonstrate the point, now referencing a "wanted liquid."

</details>

## Takeaway

#### Grammar

Toki Pona sentences now look like this:

> [subject] (li) [predicate] (e [object])

Parentheses indicate something which is optional or conditional, and brackets are stand-ins for words as before.

Breaking it down, we can talk about what the speaker and listener do, or what describes the speaker/listener:

> [mi/sina] [predicate]

We can talk about what other things do or are like:

> [subject] li [predicate]

We can now talk about what the speaker and listener do to _other things_.

> [mi/sina] [predicate] e [object]

And the same goes for what third person things do to other third person things, including themselves!

> [subject] li [predicate] e [object]

#### Content Words and Particles

The list of particles we know has grown to include `e`! Every other new word is a content word.

## Overview

This new sentence is capable of changing things in the world. The subject can now act on or apply changes to other things, with the use of `e`!

> [mi/sina] [verb/adjective] e [object]

> [subject] li [verb/adjective] e [object]

<details><summary>A note about "predicate"</summary>

In common grammatical terms, "predicate" refers to the entire verb clause, including the object(s) of the sentence.
It would be slightly more convenient, but disingenuous, to keep using predicate in place of the verb/adjective.
I considered it wrong enough to replace, meaning the alternative is to always use "verb/adjective" instead... Which is differently disingenuous!
You can't win, unless you invent a word.

Anyway, that grammatical position can be a verb, adjective, or both. It can also do other things which we'll get to, and it is the _start_ of the predicate.

</details>

In this kind of sentence, the subject usually applies the verb/adjective to the object. Here are a few examples:

<details> <summary> mi pona e jan </summary>

- I help somebody.
- I improve people.
- I heal people.
- I tend to people.
- I make people feel better.

</details>

The `jan` becomes `pona` in some way, as in the translations given.

<details> <summary> lape li wawa e sina </summary>

- Sleep makes you stronger
- Rest makes you confident
- Napping makes you energetic
- Relaxing energizes you

</details>

Here, `sina` becomes `wawa` in some way.

Not every case is like this though! Here are some examples, using two new words:

<details> <summary> jan li pilin e kiwen </summary>

- The person feels a rock.
- Somebody touched metal.
- Everyone touched this stone.
- People have been feeling this rock.

</details>

Here, the `kiwen` is _felt_ or _touched_, but it never is or becomes `pilin`.
Instead, the subject is the only one that does any `pilin`.

<details> <summary> mi wile e telo </summary>

- I want water
- I need water
- I need (liquid) fuel
- I am thirsty

</details>

Again, the `telo` is _wanted_ or _needed_, but it does not become `wile` or do the action `wile`. The subject _wants_, _needs_, `wile`.

As you study, you'll get an intuitive sense for this difference.
Some words will be actions the subject takes on an object, but which do not change that object.
Other words will change the object in some way, usually applying a new property to the object.

## Takeaway

#### Grammar

Toki Pona sentences now look like this:

> [subject] (li) [verb/adjective] (e [object])

Parentheses indicate something which is optional or conditional, and brackets are stand-ins as before.

Breaking it down, we can talk about stuff the speaker and listener do, or what the speaker/listener are like:

> [mi/sina] [verb/adjective]

We can talk about what other things do or are like, too:

> [subject] li [verb/adjective]

And we can newly talk about what the speaker, listener, or other subjects do to _other things_.

> [mi/sina] [verb/adjective] e [object]

<br>

> [subject] li [verb/adjective] e [object]

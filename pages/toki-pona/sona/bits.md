## Overview

This lesson is a big collection of quickly explained but unrelated ideas, right before the final act!

#### Proper Names

::: info

Toki Pona has a way to use names, but try _not_ using them. You'll learn a lot!

:::

In Toki Pona, you can refer to things by their name. To do this, you start with describing the thing. What kind of thing is this? Languages are `toki`, games are `musi`, and people are usually `jan`! Then you can use the name right after, like any kind of modifier.

<details><summary> mi lon ma Kanse! </summary>

I'm in France!

</details>

When written in latin characters, proper names are always capitalized at the start.

<details><summary> [mi lon ma [kiwen alasa nasin sewi esun]]{.tokipona} </summary>

I'm in France!

</details>

In [sitelen pona]{.tokipona}, proper names are written in a box, then spelled by reading the first letter of each symbol in the box. Here we spell out "Kanse," which is what France is called in Toki Pona!

::: info

Toki Pona lets people and places name themselves! For example, Japan is called "にほん (Nihon)" by Japanese speakers, so in Toki Pona, Japan is called **ma Nijon**.

:::

#### Numbers

::: info

Toki Pona has numbers, but they aren't important! If there are lots of things, use [mute]{.tokipona}. If there are a few things, try [mute lili]{.tokipona}, or nothing at all! Numbers aren't important in Toki Pona.

:::

Toki Pona has two numbers: [wan]{.tokipona} and [tu]{.tokipona}. If you read those out, it should sound like the same numbers from English: one (1) and two (2).

<details><summary> [o kama jo e ilo tu wan]{.tokipona} </summary>

Pick up three (3, 2+1) tools.

Go get three (3, 2+1) tools.

</details>

When counting things, you use numbers as modifiers. So in this example, [tu wan]{.tokipona} is like having a modifier that means "three."

[wan]{.tokipona} is one, [tu]{.tokipona} is two, [tu wan]{.tokipona} is three, [tu tu]{.tokipona} is four, and [tu tu wan]{.tokipona} is five. This keeps going, which gets long quickly! Try [mute]{.tokipona} instead of a bunch of [tu]{.tokipona} and [wan]{.tokipona}.

By the way: [wan]{.tokipona} and [tu]{.tokipona} are normal content words with meanings besides numbers:

<details><summary> [mi wan e lipu ale]{.tokipona} </summary>

I combined all the papers.

I united all the documents.

</details>

<details><summary> [soweli li tu e moku tawa pana]{.tokipona} </summary>

The animal divided up the food to gift.

The critter split up the food to give away.

</details>

You can also use the word [nanpa]{.tokipona} to rank things. [nanpa wan]{.tokipona} is often used to refer to favorites, like this:

<details><summary> [ni li pona nanpa wan tawa mi]{.tokipona} </summary>

This is my favorite!

This is the best good thing, to me!

</details>

For this, [nanpa]{.tokipona} works like [pi]{.tokipona} because it groups the words after it into one modifier- even if there is only one word after it! The new modifier is a rank, like "first" or "third."

---

If you _really, really_ want to use bigger and more specific numbers, there is a system with more numbers than one and two.

Counting with this system works exactly as before, except you have bigger numbers to use:

::: tpdefinitions

<!-- this is a hack lmao -->

| Glyph | Word | Number            |
| ----- | ---- | ----------------- |
| wan   | wan  | One (1)           |
| tu    | tu   | Two (2)           |
| luka  | luka | Five (5)          |
| mute  | mute | Twenty (20)       |
| ale   | ale  | One Hundred (100) |

:::

Here are some quick examples:

<details><summary> [sina jo e kasi mute luka tu]{.tokipona} </summary>

You have twenty seven (27, 20+5+2) plants.

</details>

<details><summary> [jan ale ale wan li lon]{.tokipona} </summary>

There are two hundred and one (201, 100+100+1) people here.

</details>

<details><summary> [mi lukin e lipu luka luka luka]{.tokipona} </summary>

I've read fifteen (15, 5+5+5) books.

</details>

#### Multiple li, e, pi, and more

##### en

##### Multiple li

To say a subject does more than one thing, you say [li]{.tokipona} again, making another predicate. Saying [li]{.tokipona} multiple times is like saying "and" in English! Here's another example:

<details> <summary> [kulupu li suli li pona]{.tokipona} </summary>

- The community is huge, and wonderful!
- The collection is enormous, and pretty!
- The stack is tall, and fantastic!

</details>

Here, the subject [kulupu]{.tokipona} is doing two different things: being [suli]{.tokipona} and being [pona]{.tokipona}.

<details> <summary> [jan li tawa li lape]{.tokipona} </summary>

- The person walks, and goes to sleep.
- The person walks, and sleeps.
- Everyone is traveling, and sleeping.

</details>

Here, [jan]{.tokipona} is doing two different things: [tawa]{.tokipona}, moving, and [lape]{.tokipona}, sleeping. Remember- Toki Pona words don't mark time, so these two actions can happen at different times!

You can have as many predicates as you want, but try to keep your sentences shorter- shorter sentences are easier to understand.

::: warning

**mi** and **sina** do not take **li**, so you can't _normally_ do this with **mi** and **sina**. Instead, use separate sentences: [mi tawa・mi lape]{.tokipona}

:::

##### Multiple e

Like [li]{.tokipona}, [e]{.tokipona} can be used more than once to apply a predicate to more than one object at a time! This applies to every object that follows a predicate. Like [li]{.tokipona}, this is like "and" in English!

<details> <summary> [mi moku e suwi e lete]{.tokipona} </summary>

I eat sugar and ice.

</details>

<details> <summary> [kasi li pilin e seli e telo]{.tokipona} </summary>

The plant is touching the fire and the water!

</details>

#### Multiple li and multiple e

When using multiple [li]{.tokipona} _and_ multiple [e]{.tokipona}, objects connect to the predicate right before.
If you use [li]{.tokipona} twice and [e]{.tokipona} after both, only the second predicate [li]{.tokipona} matters to the object [e]{.tokipona}!

<details> <summary> [kasi li suwi li pana e ko]{.tokipona} </summary>

The plant is sweet, and gives off dust!

</details>

<details> <summary> [kasi li pana e ko li suwi]{.tokipona} </summary>

The plant gives off dust, and is sweet!

</details>

Objects _always_ connect to the predicate before.
For multiple [e]{.tokipona} with multiple [li]{.tokipona}, the rules are the same as with just multiple [e]{.tokipona}!

<details> <summary> [jan li jaki e lipu li telo e lipu]{.tokipona} </summary>

The person made a mess on the book and cleaned the book.

</details>

<details><summary> A note about multiple "li" and multiple "e" </summary>

There is some room for experimentation! The above statement can be understood similarly with a relaxed grammar:

> [jan li jaki li telo e lipu]{.tokipona}

The first predicate does not connect to the object because another predicate interrupts it.
Despite that, this sentence can be understood the same as the above one.

That is, can be. It could be understood as "This person is gross, and washes the book."

If somebody doesn't understand you, try restating yourself. Using more words to be more specific is always helpful!

</details>

##### Multiple pi

When using or reading double pi, there are two possible interpretations.

- Both pi can separately modify the head of the phrase: [jan (pi pali wawa) (pi toki pona)]{.tokipona}, a person related to toki pona and strong work
- The later pi can modify the one before: [jan (pi pali wawa (pi toki pona))]{.tokipona}, a person related to strong work, and the work is toki pona related

Context tells you which is in use, but it is more clear to use no more than one pi per phrase.

Restatements for this example:

- ona li pali wawa li toki pona -> much more clear that the two are separate
- ona li pali wawa pi toki pona -> much more clear that the two are related

#### anu

We introduced [anu]{.tokipona} for questions before, in the phrase [anu seme]{.tokipona}. But it can be used similarly to the word "or" in English!

#### kin

[kin]{.tokipona} makes something additional or extra to something else. It's like saying "too" in English.

You can use it in subjects, predicates, objects, and prep phrases:

<details><summary> [mi kin li wile ni]{.tokipona} </summary>

I (and somebody else) also want to do this!

</details>

<details><summary> [kasi li loje kin]{.tokipona} </summary>

This plant is red (and another color), too!

</details>

<details><summary> [mi lukin e lipu kin]{.tokipona} </summary>

I read this book (and read something else).

</details>

<details><summary> [ona li pana e ni tawa sina kin]{.tokipona} </summary>

They gave this to you (and somebody else), too

</details>

When something is extra, it means there is another thing happening besides the thing being said!

#### funny nanpa

- [nanpa poka]{.tokipona} - A close by ranking- could be ahead or behind!
- [nanpa open]{.tokipona} and [nanpa pini]{.tokipona} - similar to "first" and "last"
- [nanpa pan]{.tokipona} The "bread"-th ranking! Not a literal rank, or done jokingly.

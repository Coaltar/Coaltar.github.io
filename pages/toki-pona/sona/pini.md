## nimi ku suli

Some of these words were given in lessons, and others were not. I've sorted them by adoption, and provide them due to the importance and influence of Toki Pona Dictionary.

## Differences

Toki Pona is a living language, and has changed over time. To better reflect Toki Pona's use in the community, a few of the definitions and uses I've given are not the same as in Toki Pona: The Language of Good, and are not what other lessons from before and after the book do either.

I do not recommend using these definitions in practice, but I've listed them here because they do still exist and you may encounter them. These definitions are in addition to those I've taught.

The previous use gives only the definition which is no longer used.
